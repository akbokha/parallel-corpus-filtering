28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up again with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had finished his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; and destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank lived in Host@@ els at first , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
&quot; combining his style with his family was to make us always something to cook , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the sign @-@ sign of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston needs not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I will always be stuck in drawers , or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather scar@@ ing me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she asks for a child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a breeze , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film works with us on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their fe@@ asts , and in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and so the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all times - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even go for photography . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid .
there are no awards for the symp@@ a@@ thetic athlete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already spotted him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is a long one .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was recorded in the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the performers include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ra@@ ke , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the row@@ er Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legend had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and d@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - Clinton , as well as Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate them to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will drive back regul@@ ations massi@@ vely , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open opportunities for dis@@ advant@@ aged and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in order to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; thus , there could be party @-@ internal discussions on Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive the coal mining in the USA again .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement it intends to termin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do is not quite clear : once he says , &quot; The minimum wage must rise , &quot; he says , he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is about boo@@ sting growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics believe him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
&quot; flee : &quot; &quot; every woman who has fled has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks inqu@@ isi@@ tively into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social relief supplies in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are slaugh@@ tered .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the establishment with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons for escap@@ ing : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; they have experience in their home with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that when they come to Germany , the end , B@@ ahr re@@ counts . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations only for them , demanding B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for instance , there is no such thing in accomod@@ ations of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , in some community shel@@ ters there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality also calls for women to be kept separate from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy , or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can come to - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; most of all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is included in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read by the crowds , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have been around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
the assistance doctors called on their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve more competition measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had missed appointments to deal with the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who had been published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently kept &quot; problems , which led to the rejection of the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted in favour of completely rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today set up a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a running program of escal@@ ating labour disputes that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A assistance denti@@ sts , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly imported . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ player in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan once again spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad .
my enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was da@@ un@@ ting .
Putin said and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , as it was done by a supposed friend . &quot;
re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one point , it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his ministry last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ j@@ sti says : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , as it looks at the response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge about the s@@ nail @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to Russia and Turkey : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated , and are now united . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents stated at the press conference that they did not even stri@@ de the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will at least speak with one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customers , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared Scotland &apos;s Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue any global goals , but also local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers under these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; said the chairman of the board . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys Champ@@ agne following a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey @-@ Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on his local circuit with his second win of the night on his local circuit , which was trained by John Gos@@ den . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too &quot;
I am very happy that this happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al fri@@ day with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ek when he takes the victory on the menu
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career chances &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already caught 6.000 profits , if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years of winners , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ th birthday .
Russian President Vladimir Ivan@@ ov fired Chief of Staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released Sergey Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special en@@ voy for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that , without stating reasons , Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov from his duties as chairman of the Russian President &apos;s Office . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that later he was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will res@@ ign on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president can suddenly run on Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - troubles@@ ome post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V received the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
when Putin reached the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;

criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series reported in a joint statement its dis@@ miss@@ al .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , spoke openly on Thursday before announ@@ cing his dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character Gib@@ sons is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son said in a release published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there to the end , but that will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a series . &quot;
the planned charis@@ ma of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a villa@@ in of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin Ba@@ in thinks it could be a Sand@@ a@@ ale for the 75 fish , which were sp@@ ed out by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown approved the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the country side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern train bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they only weighed a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men were lucky to be alive after they were thrown out of their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were un@@ lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it was loos@@ ened by the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
someone today watched over these men .
badly injured - man is stab@@ bed to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed yesterday , the 50 year old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
instead the alco@@ holi@@ zed perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her companion . &quot;
on the road they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 year old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building up @-@ to @-@ date apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken much more seriously in the future .
&quot; how do you react to the bad news , that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; Action Plan Home &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot;
but controversy is inevitable .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation has been missing so far .
&quot; said SPD group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if anyone wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be issued as social hous@@ ings in future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is as viol@@ a : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social hous@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential building program , which will cost millions of dollars and needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brand@@ mann says : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible to investors .
the Left wants even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; despite this , as viol@@ ators , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market is underway . &quot;
&quot; if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought out pending bonds from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , there are periods of time in the western city . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called mixing @-@ mix is to be removed . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in the boat for a broad majority . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a Hun@@ t for Health and Happ@@ iness , worth it &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out with their smartphones out and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and le@@ apt for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as usual , there are also gr@@ ump@@ y game per@@ ks that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
&quot; due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
all along the line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast rang the competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
her overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five clu@@ b@@ team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ al@@ lion Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the suspended beam during the single multi @-@ fight campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman , who wins a competition title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u ba@@ il@@ out she said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight campaign of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bal@@ es insisted on never having planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led slightly through two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
suspended beams and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
&quot; she again picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still put one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her indignation - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called Grand@@ ma by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her exercise , she threw away the crowds , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ous cases when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous of Phoenix while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots of a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a predat@@ or , since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting prevented the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were linked to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two more wounded in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , aimed at an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I have not left myself on this .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l up until his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; emer@@ gen@@ cies , F@@ loo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on their way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inch rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downward @-@ directional floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 9@@ am , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still acc@@ eded people of flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ be on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another son of boots that lives near would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed up to Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was much more balanced by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua destroyed 200 houses flooded .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , which were now flooded . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to floods and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining at the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday no reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by balls , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with the fact that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge tubes for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it was clearly a long struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said police inspec@@ tor Anthony G@@ inal@@ di to the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently re@@ port@@ edly checked the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ blo@@ gger when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she is re@@ covering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning and for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ be , who is a Catholic , rounds out , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see trainers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same road as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competitive and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ n@@ astic and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs to support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to enable the assemblies to be inspired by innum@@ erable young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access sports training . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ foundation 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gym@@ n@@ astic that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted in favour of a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans were un@@ v@@ eiling the agreement and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and that any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors will receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend stays , in order to improve the maintenance of time @-@ care times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance B@@ ets announced last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors still have serious concerns regarding the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat the current workforce crisis and ad@@ ore it to just treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve the disputes caused by discussions were to take part in the government for the reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes listen to ear @-@ de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always stand out . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , raise the vibration and address the concerns of assistance doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further training measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide physicians on the strip chain cover . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day remuneration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance doctors , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Emplo@@ ye@@ es , called on the assistance doctors to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; competition measures achieve nothing but little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive engagement to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of curriculum , continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the co@@ agulation medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , which reduces the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots die , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the line design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , have a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ning Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud being ignor@@ antly ignored in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral fraud due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off bands outside elec@@ ting cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should carry out an identification with them in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes that non @-@ removable ink can be applied to the finger of a person if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions on non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but should also protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election scandal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the Muslim duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm in the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence with which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding le@@ aks to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ derly , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists work on let@@ tu@@ b@@ ings to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider choosing voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure that they are random@@ ized .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic correspondence .
prohibition that political activists edit full letter elections and envel@@ opes from letter elections .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off for electoral stations .
&quot; a change of law , which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 . &quot;
photograph@@ ing prohibited in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters are alone in the bal@@ lot box .
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country is a proud heir as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have advised the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by far not the only one to have gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games which show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star , secretly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see any simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big , expressive eyes , is supposed to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one step higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ man who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
Russian silver med@@ alli@@ ons Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to equ@@ ate an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; indeed , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese float died like a pig

&quot; the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , at the end of the 4x@@ 200m pool squ@@ ad@@ ron to give his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was taken on board into the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; &quot; colour &quot; , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as low as a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for that .

&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eted , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show .
Ai Mar@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection to the baby .
&quot; the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was fast and hard , in which many people were talking about it . &quot;
Twitter users did not think back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # made .
&quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with people responding to the Twitter via Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; however , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that she was interpreted as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where they were supposed to see , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
she continued browsing and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants , before she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , she went off and went out of business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out their own pants and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went off and went out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; How can I think that someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been withdrawn from sales .
how to protect yourself against weapons attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you are approaching from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the shot , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with his knee in the gro@@ in and twist , while the attack@@ er is com@@ mitting before pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on it . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the cast line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi makes .
&quot; but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is most secure to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller pulled down his immune system and th@@ ep@@ her@@ al@@ iser of a serious test - by le@@ aning out some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ ck of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the idea to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public roads to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task placed its immune system definitely under a test &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was definitely justified by his call . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after her lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of Da@@ iry Products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting in@@ doors .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D. in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the meaning of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things that I instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion with a £ 50,000 loss , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls cleared holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way .
there are many things to consider because this property is thought to be considered as not such a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , addic@@ tions of residents , drug abuse , traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up . &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing made her and her partner violent from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to Hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the village house tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter ad@@ mits to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their acts had to be terrible for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work done by my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don got a fine after having found himself guilty of ow@@ ning a drug of class B in trade @-@ law .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ u@@ ge rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without repro@@ ach , as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ lu@@ ent military jet flying over the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ guese zone P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force took an unbelievable crash
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk . &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ s , without first seeing what came through the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane crashed on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; today , Portuguese air forces stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said the jet flew a bit deeper than usual due to poor visibility in the vicinity , but the air forces insisted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which four people also died on the island Madeira . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese air forces stated that the pilot had to fly as low as a result of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke - as low as his view limits . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with a worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ play increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ Win@@ ner must compete with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe @-@ League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
&quot; at least for the time being , Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years now .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the competitions took the lead . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ par@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince . &quot;
&quot; Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with eleven achievements , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in its own league for table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner .
&quot; on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; thus the world @-@ ranking solo@@ ist won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title of each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the upper@@ most Olympic @-@ deal was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have any coaches . &quot;
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ actors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches until here , I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequ@@ enti@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were awarded the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was unexpectedly one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 year old opponent , Ma had really had to fight in the first set . &quot;
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , however , there were enough stunning balloon changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the match for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ts@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ se had bred a ri@@ pple @-@ injury in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als , after that in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to settle with sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way in a similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave up the short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former U@@ tah Repub@@ lican strongh@@ old .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire typically appears to be a large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , as a matter of concern , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after being thrown out of the race for 16 ri@@ vals within his own Repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success are growing in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilty were false reports of his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media news . &quot;
w@@ ack@@ le Repub@@ lican Up@@ bur@@ sts
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were balancing . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : this will &quot; either be successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he makes no difference as &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for political correctness , that &apos;s fine , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened Tr@@ ump to make money for the support of his campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be more involved in Congress than the arms . &quot;
Olympia : thir@@ ster sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary reported that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , left a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er in the Olympic village . &quot;
this was reported to the K@@ eni@@ as team leader by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , and shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will review an assessment , &quot; stated it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; declared K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation chief Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed about pending d@@ oping tests against cash payments of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; after numerous dop@@ ing tests in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special observation for some time now . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a large runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a substantial mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it has been proven that in this type of sport it was dou@@ bly t@@ apped and systematically dop@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth room . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members melanch@@ oly to her boy@@ friend with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be there .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; Bart@@ oli laughs . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli goes back to the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ tig@@ ers went to New York and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London went into an airplane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory near Gar@@ land as candidate for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expected to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain amount of certainty .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not spoken to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; in RAID , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants neck calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine of ol@@ d@@ school play@@ boys differ because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently it is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; those who do not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish congregation of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , even &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime comb@@ ats minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already mig@@ rated from the months of Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ei@@ led coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or driven out over the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the chief of the group called for the Federal Government to position &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a witch hunt is held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the brand@@ mark as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper under reference to numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all eligible candidates ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are no fighting against war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually followed . &quot;

&quot; in 2021 , the state election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than so far , it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
&quot; the most vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come about : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count towards the end , only work hard . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again had to pass an election campaign short of the people passing by . &quot;
the hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun .
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party ever since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strongly new@@ bie Af@@ D is cutting off , and what remains at the end of coalition du@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one can see from its large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ts a bit with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
otherwise se@@ ering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We are creating this &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s federal election district lies in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U renoun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , Kok@@ ert thinks , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noticed that on the land , it is crum@@ bling the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village festivals , golden wedding receptions , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is in stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in the opinion poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the 2011 election , the SPD had yet clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Parliament . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and transfer their election campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the president , Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green election fighters embar@@ k on a search for domestic voters among the holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gische lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
their impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and ending at about 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything a bit jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the meeting is also commen@@ sur@@ ate for those responsible for construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of station entran@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now move on both sides from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 .
the transit traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the Vice President Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping things were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
this led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ king .
&quot; since the speed limits were not met , the assembly also called for the M@@ ös@@ singen vehicle . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exceed@@ ances , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been sli@@ t .
the fastest speed was 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men on the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that now the street is open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has resulted in sales collap@@ ses at them , allows everyone to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most stri@@ ven streets are the restaurants along the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly known as Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants had hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far above 50 per cent &quot; , &quot; the sales revenue is quoted &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road building has been &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
he has to discharge half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled . &quot;
&quot; at all claims , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance he can understand .
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive up , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly scre@@ wed to laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not over@@ demand anyone .
other further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in this .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was concerned with results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; in response to the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority to deal with the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
nor does the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals not made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; states the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; he still believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which in any case has no chances with the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , too . &quot;
they have some in mind : he plans rapid proceedings for de@@ port@@ ations and more ways to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before deportation .
refugees who are deliberately picked up in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of toler@@ ations for expi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse things worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity . &quot;
some of these are politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
some still seem un@@ enlightened and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the im@@ balance between tolerated , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; said de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security . &quot;
and things that people deeply dealt with could not be cl@@ apped even in times of election .
the inner security has moved tremend@@ ously into the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; with regard to internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ nish dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the dual nationality . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from a double @-@ pass .
we have concluded the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish them is not sensible .
and he has constitutional concerns with a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all angles and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , it must still be demonstrated . &quot;
there is a lot in what could cause a fight .
but the SPD is currently trying to stand out on the subject of internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming in a lim@@ pf@@ ul way .
&quot; despite diesel variants , the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but it does not work in all markets .
&quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen is launching restra@@ ined deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can boast a plus despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the VW core brand weak@@ ens especially in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened total sales as the company announced in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year level . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries decreased by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; sales of brands Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures out of July , above all on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a purchase price in some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas was first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still worse by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 per cent is to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
sales of sales Fred Kap@@ pler continued from January to July .
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer guarantees a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in Corporate Travel . &quot;
reason to be j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that this meeting was held .
&quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; , &quot; as it was called in company circles . &quot;
&quot; in the long term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen is able to see the possibility that for example , for example , customers can come to a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the tape scandal , leads to uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see will be asked by rich savers in the future - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or day money accounts . &quot;
the German B@@ anks Association speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their savings .
&quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to withdraw from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding € 100,000 in sight deposit accounts or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in future will be 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been taking 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and that he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lie down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now going on . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash just sit in the T@@ res@@ ins of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four rob@@ ber@@ ies , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the CFO . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the Co@@ operative Association Bayern explained : &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; it alone is not possible to wear them alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with penalty rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the Lake of T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele which is endow@@ ed with a bit more vol@@ up@@ tuous of wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if she keeps money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria , which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going to the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard and there is a threat to the migration of investors to the competition .
customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle @-@ old men love plates .
&quot; before you hurry to comment under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ y Men &apos;s middle age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the widely discussed revival of records does not rely on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who bought a record recently are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record purch@@ as@@ ers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me as I run in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something like : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I count from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford as they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 working with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the you@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have gotten rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business such as ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers received impetus from the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some music fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that ev@@ oke happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff member fli@@ rts from a record stack . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % possess a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I stro@@ ve through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just recently came in and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has an entertaining audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer and sex@@ t@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but the psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
it &apos;s more of a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ pressed si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the note to mu@@ stering jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a dad and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels by Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; disk art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camps
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be allowed to submit 72 provisional shops where people sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that hold a fire and sanitary risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rain was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matter for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; for these children a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants stated on Friday that the number of migrants living in the jungle @-@ ager rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite the Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ pro@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to stop . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s past , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyse in peace what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time of the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin really wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed in recent times .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ urer : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident concentrations , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary templates , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed heater to comply with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; in addition , laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , as well as access restrictions by time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in order for it not to be cl@@ amped simply , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ proof outer cover disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold picks up
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic med@@ ley of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the bu@@ cks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago they lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
&quot; this conclusion will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wondering and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce off G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with only four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a prot@@ rac@@ ted ch@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man @-@ Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a had a touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new song since the second , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still cores . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant intermediate play by Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ an sul@@ t@@ ans whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged himself and G@@ TC ki@@ cked badly into the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown made the bu@@ cks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more emer@@ al gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first rowing beat until the last , 220 hard drives that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written assignment , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference , and there was no one who knew it as the coach who had not been able to survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he is spreading everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances was the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
rowing on itself is already a challenge but that makes it an even bigger one .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that may be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked with .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked myself a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , st@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very trapped at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary care provided for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; exemplary in Bavaria . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; for some time now , it was called the &quot; &quot; Bavarian Radio &quot; &quot; in a contribution to the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government was accused of con@@ ta@@ gion . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was exemplary in &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the compulsory association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , which is based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 villages and wil@@ ler with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse , and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always picked up new features as water life means that drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age , and he really lived the water @-@ purpose band@@ age as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group on nit@@ rate reduction prior to the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller first praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a faithful bu@@ ck .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the pipe at a church lou@@ der on a 3 January . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn one can only be maintained , because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer of Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko leaves open with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight year old Ti@@ ago had progres@@ sed well and now learn to work privately in New York , where the best therap@@ ists exist . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday .
&quot; the man has called upon us and indicated to have killed his wife , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brow@@ ned and has a bald head . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with himself , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck would not have to provide any information about the death or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more about this at the moment , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from the green power supply are from the table .
&quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Sett@@ lement in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity production for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls . &quot;
but even this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
this will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; campaign this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed down in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation was exac@@ erb@@ ated when China &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw massive steel on the world market in light of the weaker domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imported import duties have been imposed on the import steel effect ; on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price of the price is .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are still cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in succession . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an increase in orders thanks to an improved order situation . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does a good job for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s room she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sang in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she does something good to her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly ask for their lungs are not so fast out of the powder in everyday life .
singing is an optimal hobby even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age .
&quot; on older people singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Party of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth period . &quot;
&quot; through song lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers have long forgotten events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adjusting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially the elderly , who live alone , do so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I take a long time for something , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate , even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who can hear when a tone goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a senior &apos;s choir , you can simply join in . &quot;

cats react sensi@@ tively as cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the fen of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the chi@@ cks .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which in great need choose how scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
&quot; han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the investig@@ ator of the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency . &quot;
a total of nine adult male cat and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the M@@ H@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a herd of babies who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned to the speaker faster when this calls were played by the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the arch @-@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even when the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government compla@@ ined that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the motion of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
there is also no stop before football .
&quot; against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South American living in America has now been accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r is supposed to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually does not have any effects on the life of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; traditionally , fans of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot;
&quot; what unites the great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially popular with Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; Cologne in the past season demonstrated its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory bull .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will also say goodbye to the Europa League soon . &quot;
&quot; in the southern Li@@ g , it was enough to rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as the Sü@@ me@@ g @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shield King . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez , which was only borrow@@ ed at AC Florence , had been announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; but in order to do so , the temp@@ est would have to be willing to wai@@ ve about one @-@ third of the annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing , these athletes still have med@@ als in the Olympic Games in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who claimed her start right shortly before the game after a dop@@ ing lock , was beaten mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery was offered : with a set smile , she was still stum@@ bling into the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when she noticed that she was not getting gold , the audience broke out in a rush storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Rio Olympics in spite of the dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its inc@@ iner@@ ation , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to leave a six month lock in 2010 after having been shown the seizure of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , the world champion of 2013 and European championships , was positively tested by the banned stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the deliber@@ ate intake and was banned six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ ulated Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als later . &quot;
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
&quot; in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship due to testosterone abuse . &quot;
he also received the recognised bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a part of the International Court of Justice of the CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record holder and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of taking a forbidden food supplement was found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA had fallen mil@@ dly and went off on July 13 . &quot;
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian grave bre@@ aches - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , &quot; &quot; said the foreign ministry spokesman , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her return trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens are affected , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life @-@ life quarter . &quot;
&quot; according to the police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , a further human being killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , popular with holiday@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flo@@ wer@@ bed in front of the territorial police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast caused several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ met@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
one rather assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed of the exact time and place . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , on its homepage , is recommen@@ ding the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ v@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ar and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for necessary trips to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a big influence over the coming years .
&quot; said Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha , the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ affir@@ med himself of having led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on Muslim rebels that have been sm@@ oul@@ dering in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
&quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
the right @-@ wing &quot; identity movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
&quot; according to several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; reference points for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said constitutional manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic fai@@ ths or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ del@@ usion , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and &quot; the loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; Identi@@ ty bears &quot; are already observed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the national offices during the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the constitution . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for your own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ aries &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Do not know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the protection of the constitution , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at some point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , he said he would not speak of a new right @-@ wing terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legi@@ tim@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it can be quite possible that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned themselves , Mao said that many attacks went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspect in case of attacks on asylum shel@@ ters had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records are not always determining the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sponge so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his CV with a 48 @-@ second set@@ back and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
some media described him as the &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; well @-@ being , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a race over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop on the New Place has been stolen .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der had left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she returned the next morning at 8 : 15 o &apos;clock , some 250 Euro had disappeared from the cash desk . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the threat of electoral defeat so narrow
&quot; the Repub@@ lican candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot;
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end , it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for political correctness , that &apos;s fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; so he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
mail enters commerce with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the Post Office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been testing for months whether they are delivered to their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other farms . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to take part in a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we outline the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany &apos;s streets since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership meets dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann to be even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the worldwide number five in the industry faces a new beginning . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the Executive Board intends to leave the company . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the Executive Board of Management Board , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , has already taken over the management board as of 1 September , and shared the company . &quot;
&quot; he is supposed to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; board speaker &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
the company called &quot; differing views &quot; for the long @-@ term business @-@ political orientation as a reason for the return .
the company spokesman on Friday did not want to mention details .
&quot; in the future , anyone who will be conducting the market research company is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago had been great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the most recent Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so . &quot; &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable level of the previous year &apos;s quarter . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to 72@@ 1.2 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was primarily imp@@ acted by the uns@@ atis@@ factory value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , tot@@ aled EUR 139 million for the Group , including a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ yo@@ n in dit@@ ches : eight injured
&quot; in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hö@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries and shared the police .
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their data , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which was partly on the opposite track . &quot;
the bus stopped right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade delivered the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance car came to the accident site on state road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ble district P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and potential witnesses to contact the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3.@@ 44 Euro for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh area , 3.@@ 44 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a high @-@ cost calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the Office of the Agriculture Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach noted that for these sewage systems under@@ lay had to run . &quot;
&quot; due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ covering basis . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens , as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt pointed out , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage works of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period should also be excluded . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the serious ventilation increase , Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with a very low wastewater attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water flow in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; in spite of their age , renovation and repair expenses were also considerable in all three systems due to their age . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ ez almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the waste water plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be disposed of , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; the continued care and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period came to these extraordinary expenses .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still clearly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully sm@@ ashed .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed from the waste water facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses , as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility station is not to be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent . &quot;
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; free time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ flo@@ wered , self @-@ winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all dis@@ appearances come to the public .
&quot; in the past , snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised themselves in which they were accused of using the app black face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were spread widely on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was designed as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , rec@@ alled the filter of breaking c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others decided to reject the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and least said . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been moved to the extreme extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are different in race than their older counter@@ parts - could assume more , sensitivity to expect . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters produces an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that ra@@ ci@@ d controversi@@ es would reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership , and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a human resource manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said she added to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence information , adju@@ sts Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , a report committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican members of the Committee Com@@ mittees , Secret Service Com@@ mit@@ ee and Ar@@ ms Com@@ mit@@ es , reports on great dis@@ content among Central Command &apos;s intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , typically bl@@ ended by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com units , regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on @-@ site and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ com range from the top to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before Congress were much more positive than facts , &quot; the report noted . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ es could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command was changing intelligence reports to reduce the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the intelligence community published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of Adam B. Schiff &apos;s House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; sh@@ amed the mor@@ als among analysts and gave excessive space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the democr@@ ats announced that they had no clu@@ es to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who had been accepted after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress &apos;s reports while investigating the General In@@ spec@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts at times have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions of the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes between more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , written a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government agencies stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the oil refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US won fourth match in the women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain is pending &quot;
&quot; one day after having fired three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American March team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember what ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in memory .
&quot; however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will take the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
the first place will take a little longer from the strong Dutch to lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss over their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder completely s@@ nat@@ ched around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back @-@ handle from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without any victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and ines@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlon . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , might have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised : pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was perceived so vivi@@ dly that many people I had inter@@ viewed did not know that it is a sport of the Olympics anyway . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had been an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more fitting for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit , that I am not an expert , but only a bon@@ ded enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending clas@@ h - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much like &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic program , they are rated according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; medal @-@ hoping leaders must go further , faster , up and down in their pursuit of gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic champion . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented quest is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no v@@ ault into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
&quot; the qualifying and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time , which the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympic @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be reached by the monkey and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner suggested recently , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to be cor@@ rupted . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia inter@@ tw@@ ined ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or jail , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Sev@@ li@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a vision@@ ally critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this fragile , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liber@@ al Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were more or less defeated in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and be armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of extinction under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians believed that they were so prot@@ esting .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was sent to Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special agents to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested , which apparently fed by the government according to the statements of analysts , and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this period of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s leaders praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their measurable progress in fighting poverty . &quot;
but clearly this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ gi@@ vings of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it is taking a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ orous city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , attacking his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
this clari@@ fication posed new questions on the communication skills of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; presidential candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow campaig@@ ners , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements that he might not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was calling back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump told him that he was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help weak@@ en the statement , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican candidate wanted to know nothing about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism ra@@ zz@@ led down Mr. Tr@@ ump as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction occurs . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of resol@@ ving the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump reck@@ oned with an even more corro@@ bor@@ ating tone as his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump sums up his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable position to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense , it is true that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ ker , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; prior to the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of rus@@ hing around each of his words and being bi@@ ased towards him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
&quot; once over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point is back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a not@@ orious café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , but there was no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years served good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie , which replaced the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural rice bowls .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave the coffee drink for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended cha@@ i tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the association , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the association in 2003 . &quot;
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably appointed the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap shop had taken the old business room .
&quot; indeed , the Ow@@ ners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for tasting with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish residents , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preten@@ ded to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ thful for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was talking about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bri@@ ck@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her newest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag shows the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ eless snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; ordered as the re@@ porter h@@ acker roast , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which is the ingredient . &quot;
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
counter gr@@ inning .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pie for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the roads with which the country was about to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was considered a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; &quot; says Bri@@ ck@@ man , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixes were tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also contains recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - looked at the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; households &quot; and to turn P@@ amp@@ e into delicious meals like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ myself @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude , are tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the millions @-@ million man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called upon him to take an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the residents of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of a brick @-@ in @-@ law mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot; &quot;
there was the outbreak of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared from Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was an evil trick to give a humble name to a humble name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved , reluct@@ antly , a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E took a supplement three times .
&quot; he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians , which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved the lives of almost 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game , in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour saving of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans the shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , he said , &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one of which was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation . &quot;
he was born 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks have only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates on a rich 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle marked by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least from a Green@@ lan@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already assumed that Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks will be stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; their slow motion measured them , when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sh@@ arks who caught the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye @-@ l@@ enti@@ ls arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; their birth , therefore , should lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search for larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the l@@ enti@@ le core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland h@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no accident that such meth@@ ot@@ al@@ icul@@ es live above all in icy waters .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land w@@ al , whose bacon on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught up before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal em@@ its heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives in danger and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
the Municipal Council has dealt mainly with topics related to construction in the recent session .
&quot; with relief , the committee accepted the release of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential area can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and settlement requests were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying were clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schö@@ nau attract young families and former senior citizens equally .
&quot; as it was said , builders can report from now on in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet requests for res@@ ett@@ ling further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; for example , the industrial area that has already been designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the City of the Main , therefore , has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary buildings will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient to grant them approval in the UK . &quot;
that &apos;s what big US banks use .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is meeting the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk corporate ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , though , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it is not cutting itself off as much as Dublin does in the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the River Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company advis@@ ers Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxemburg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial center for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot;

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed from damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ vor@@ i of Gilead after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , granted to Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say they have resum@@ ed full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the US have conquered full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a spokesman of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( CS@@ TO ) cur@@ b after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have dug itself within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have delivered over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish shared the man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , who was al@@ lied to the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in speech recognition ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million to the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idents , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ lam on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats &quot; presidential candidates . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps critics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his funds for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already jumped on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue . &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS , and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the elec@@ tors and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax returns as far back as 2007 .
&quot; the clinics now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income is considered a reward , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ es , fire@@ works encourage dance ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania utilize an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going settlements in people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion together with U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; Friday is the day of the day , dedicated to animal welfare . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , being more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant &quot; , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication . &quot;
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and the bubbles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with soil is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ign@@ iter . &quot;
&quot; when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ es into the air . &quot;

&quot; one last option is a shi@@ mmer , who shoots a gold @-@ fired fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , light explosion . &quot;

&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment project of commercial operators with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and is considered to be much more effective in the retail sector in the city . &quot;
&quot; however , the town council unanim@@ ously refused the request for the new construction of a sales car on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine profile . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots en@@ gros@@ sed a media stir after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli elections as it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
attributed to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there &quot; attracted him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the Internet , in which people called it a scandal . &quot;
&quot; some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; arrest &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; to not pick up Israel in the quick @-@ election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo , when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to deal with the students , which led to the police enforcement of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the State State Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts being spra@@ yed against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
recent protests occurred a few days after prot@@ esters in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador stated . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that sales between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; trade down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representative issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily for travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses wanted : beverage market inv@@ aded in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y event has been practiced on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; in front of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had mur@@ mu@@ red their faces from the beverage merchant &apos;s staff demanded the issu@@ ance of cash and then fled initially on foot , and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the drink market is accessible and accessible directly from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and moved from the gravel car park opposite the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly heading towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the crime ( at about 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; during the first school holiday week , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ ows with a visit to the stro@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; to the other after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group spent on the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers were treated to culinary delights such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were designed to create beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the journey home , the sun and the children and young people returned satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ ers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg along a four @-@ day hike from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the St. Anna district council has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been checked and one finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ en@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms went on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady stands and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way started from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made a break to sing together a song from specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for overnight stays , parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and star@@ chy evening meal and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the next day I went to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at first we had to drop some 500 meters in the heat and then get up again afterwards . &quot;
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening .
&quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; at the evening show in Münster , Min@@ is welcomed the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the Men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow embark@@ ed on the anch@@ or@@ age of his comp@@ atri@@ ot , Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ckey &apos;s retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner put a qualifying round in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward , and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , when Hin@@ des went into a higher gear in order to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked out from his position as BBC expert and fell down Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic med@@ ina and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ di said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we came together as a team over the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympi@@ ad again .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the bicycle . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he has repeated Ho@@ ckey &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ mil@@ eage . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security . &quot;
&quot; he had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification , when he called him function@@ aries to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Des@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in a world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
&quot; drama in the background played out in the background , such as the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical director in April in the midst of sex and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es and the retirement of variables such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
&quot; the future of Port@@ land melt , due to the lifting of the energy contract &quot;
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy fixed for 20 years will take place in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; no less than 2,000 work@@ stations - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt pump consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the Schmel@@ ing of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
&quot; this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ elter with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging business , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will be contributing to the revenue in the business year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures prices for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L stated that the value of the contracts had already been written down in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el , or to guarantee the power supply to the enam@@ el . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still deb@@ ated why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the industry &apos;s poor economic conditions prior to the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land would consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; that wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan . Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the view brought me to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sp@@ iced reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ venti@@ l@@ ated plot nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we forgot you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow at this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with safety . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes to see what the Vo@@ gue cover has dealt with ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista was from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome containing 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot;
the disclosure of his cover @-@ star is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine continued to pass through the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were definitely more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the mod@@ ells &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga was honored . &quot;
&quot; but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her the mist@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but walking around seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is to be seen in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; a total of 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s Relief Clu@@ sters are rejected annually by the communities of the municipality , while the industry is concerned with the effects of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is envis@@ aged that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell Community Centre said that the last survey conducted by the National Assembly of Convention Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only get worse without the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s common centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that go through separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems in a legal way and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut resources by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without assistance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal issues . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused by re@@ port@@ edly pulling gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action , after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on a staff while they were in je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday in Charlotte &apos;s Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months for the matter to be regulated internally , before he realised that &quot; it would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i noted that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate triggered an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign clearly showed that the media would have torn his words from the context , and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ord@@ is complaint requests damages from the campaign to breach the duty of care , and from Philip because of bodily injury and permanent mental damage . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the press spokesperson for press spokes@@ woman &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; was not to be reached for a statement . &quot;
&quot; try to contact Philip , too . &quot;
&quot; C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; the Repub@@ lican candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , has so far led a controversial campaign . &quot;
&quot; the procedure is B@@ ord@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President , Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling party . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could no longer go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances to continue to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , and the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were returning to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , the N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Parliament . &quot;
according to the survey the SPD of the survey showed only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U was only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it thus still stands behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but in contrast to 2011 the pirates would miss the move . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market .
&quot; today , its success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but somehow they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West pocket format . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone could set a lot for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even accessing websites was possible via HTML browsers , though very slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smart phone era .
everything has changed since then .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market is domin@@ ating vendors that came a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is for very many people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion units sold , on Samsung and Apple , accounted for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple began the triumph@@ al march , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; after all , you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws are now Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
&quot; 20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn how to get the Smartphone away &quot; , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Board of Human Resources . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ rows , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be playing on the world stage .
&quot; the two @-@ f@@ ishers were wrong in 2012 , and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth , leaving a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and all the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding advertising block &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ades on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding with respect to his advertisements in order to make it difficult to identify which part of the page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &apos;s spokesman wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been underway between the time @-@ breaking open source community and the conver@@ ters since the invention of indicators block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display block@@ ers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lo@@ aders , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; the company has been targeting advertising block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokesman . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , making Facebook the investment of such a step as re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said that Ad@@ blocks would cause new filters to cause concern because they would block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on Develop@@ er tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman in case of presum@@ ed suicide over@@ ride on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident took place on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark , &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who prompt them and every witness of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; that &apos;s something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after crossing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , absorbed the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate models : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
&quot; scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms , which resemble those of climate scientists . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus , with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once again have out@@ law@@ ed earth @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and yet slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to harbor life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus expon@@ enti@@ ates its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; explained scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans have evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or has been blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che coach
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a small co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position . &quot;
during the summer I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and we wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league .
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the post season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ ee@@ el@@ workers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to the remuneration for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all parties put on the table for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the Oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of winding down the current dispute , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold several full day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to re @-@ address the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden
&quot; the latest mission , with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope , has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in the star @-@ building to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods with the planet origin are standing . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ tips , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
now they are the fastest .
&quot; at peak @-@ rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars stum@@ ble in large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest generation of rot@@ ational rates shows that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be carrying the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star Game Director of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future serve as advisor and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar characteristics in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the hall hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , due to the involvement of the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even do me a favor in 2014 , because I have played through 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot;
his farewell days are not silent either .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and who is following the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; 2016 Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing incidents &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a well @-@ known bul@@ letin would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing incidents in Rio de Janeiro have become known . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - these news came to an end immediately prior to the start of the athle@@ tics competitions . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was proven last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have had to participate in the runs of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news came across the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is alleged that the banned substance will be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen was said to have had a positive impact . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was well @-@ known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the start of the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , also the runner nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the previous tensions in China were also cat@@ ered for violent confron@@ tations among the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun was at the center of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested by the Chinese nationals for the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to wait a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; data c@@ law : so per@@ fi@@ de , hack@@ ers black@@ ish their ran@@ som &quot;
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already achieved a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators are increasingly speci@@ alizing in attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som is much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently monitoring a sc@@ ary rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ tur@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ war@@ e@@ programmes were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks carried out quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als in a sustainable way .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ ise Bit@@ coin - . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is struck . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of patient records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion that the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to earn more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ code free sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of only a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the so @-@ called malware kits have been created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ers then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so one logs in one of the underground forums , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers to spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations instead , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , depending on the type of data , damage potential is much higher than ever . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take up entirely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m tall , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the interior &apos;s materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the cockpit is falling down . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with folded back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seats of the back bench can be folded up like a movie chair , thus providing storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; however , he should do his job somewhat more quietly . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top option &quot; Executive . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision warning is sometimes irrit@@ ated by ass@@ uring many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ ates the speed when needed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ jack are located underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical of aviation . &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have passed anywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of illness : when will the organis@@ er be paid ?
&quot; after their journey , ill tourists only receive money when the cause of the disease is du@@ bi@@ ous in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this is , however , only the case when more than ten percent of the guests can demonstrate the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , a family was heavily ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ key holiday . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their disease caused the tourists to return to a defective sewage treatment plant , which was said to have polluted sea water . &quot;
the family believed that the trip had been inadequate - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organizer was informed shortly before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
&quot; until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine . &quot;
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , thus the judgment . &quot;
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; according to the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and determined to react at the same time to terrorist threats .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminal offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , however , it hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve the implementation of proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be re@@ proved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is intended to improve the fire law so that it is difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly opposed Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
&quot; as a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , it is not constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to talk about rules , for example , in street traffic or for witnesses in court . &quot;
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate the act of action and capacity to act with ever new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; left @-@ wing party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay are no longer safe for people in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ ole regularly on the road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all mot@@ orists who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jam , when they drive via the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße , at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go directly from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is for@@ ging early , thus improving the total flow of time on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
&quot; the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves drivers , especially between 17 and 19 hrs . &quot;
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , the traffic is only guided in a single lane by the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected hard @-@ to @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent regional company will not be able to say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : the bridge has an official remaining useful life by 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; Das un@@ seen Haus . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; Das un@@ seen Haus &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by the NGO N@@ ima , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the staging of the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class came to Münster in September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the choreography , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , such as the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without a refugee and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language placement are planned .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project continues .
&quot; in view of the increased quantities of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of the weather
&quot; the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ppy in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a stroke through the bill , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the heavenly spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stell@@ ations are per@@ sei@@ ls , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing Sta@@ y : tips against Sle@@ eping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep and over ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders occur ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , says Hans @-@ Günter V@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Beauty and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what we understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and transit distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; many people just feel sleep@@ y as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication . &quot;
sleeping disorder is not rare .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially in a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors are subject to one another .
&quot; for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be ill , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to greet each other via everyday problems and worries , We@@ eh@@ ub gives an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
&quot; the impairment may look very different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicine - classical sleeping tablets just in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , stresses that there is hardly any fallen sleep physician in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should first contact the family doctor if you suffer from sleeping problems . &quot;
it can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
&quot; for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breathing difficulties , in case of day@@ time fatigue , sleeping @-@ walking or if you do not find the cause of a sleep problem , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not have a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ ing , you go to bed at a normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping places . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which you can put on a better sleep .
&quot; keep in mind : regular bed@@ - and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch the clock at night - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first scored gold at the short @-@ track world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler , via Facebook , prot@@ ested in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 150@@ ,000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the funding system in swimming sports is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look exactly at D@@ oping or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be adjusted , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , he would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who do not have a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; asks the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot;
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years . &quot;
&quot; as a band , the susp@@ ects had made several bags and luggage racks . &quot;
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang of ties known to polic@@ emen from past th@@ rob@@ ber@@ y off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of Criminal Police 34 can demonstrate four actions to thi@@ eves , who had been specially admitted to commit crimes to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had captured a total of over € 15,000 . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still a rem@@ nant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; however , in recent weeks article about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard procedure by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol for three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers moved away under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk vor@@ m late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who has drawn up three children here , are above all irrit@@ ated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a &quot; Kie@@ z , &quot; which demands police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police put between home owners and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in , in the east of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today also has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly all of the Main@@ zer Straße close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from all over the world in recent years : now residents from the GDR and former home owners share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can see them attached to win@@ dow@@ ed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been thrown with color bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences , such as bodily injury , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : people in the 94 are their neighbors , who are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer moved consciously to the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remained .
&quot; it was therefore important for her to get back home : from the police , politics and media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the district . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not as good as they are , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ iled ones who are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the skin projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who pul@@ ls out should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can &apos;t complain about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee influ@@ x
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client of the working group points out that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the sham@@ eless fle@@ ece of wool , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking rather than relying on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the passage . &quot;
&quot; an administration specialist was sought out with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a sham@@ eless wo@@ ol@@ ly sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not her central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are great and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers are standing in the laundry &quot;
&quot; for some time now , a serious problem has been to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must submit the refugees in their own or rented accommodation areas .
&quot; the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility shifts from the Board of Directors to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , management does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not working to rely on private apartments , &quot; says Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be restored as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers will be placed in the washing line . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master craftsmen , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; thus , administration and honorary officials also jump in here . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany , and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can easily bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not work and is useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the recent incidents fear radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; what some people might call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would make them completely call@@ ous .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary am@@ bass@@ adors have to look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
it is always in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics are afraid . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner .
&quot; these are about 100 people at present , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
&quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot;
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the bar@@ b@@ arians in flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 feet tall , well escaped , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled toward the city centre .
&quot; for the prosecution , the police deployed several squ@@ ab@@ ies as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the gene@@ alogy proc@@ eeded without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown fell in front of the apartment or at their escape . &quot;
