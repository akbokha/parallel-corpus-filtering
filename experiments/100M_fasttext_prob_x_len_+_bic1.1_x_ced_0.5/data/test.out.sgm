<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their feasts, and in the fast gallop they hunted home to the feeding troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer from all times - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even go for photography."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are no awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, silver laurel leaf, champions-tour-player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already spotted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is a long one.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US Masterssieger was recorded in the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the performers include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Girake, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legend had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion where the Lavazza price was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and dumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - Clinton, as well as Trump."</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate them to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive back regulations massively, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open opportunities for disadvantaged and needs money. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in order to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, there could be party-internal discussions on Trump."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive the coal mining in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement it intends to terminate."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with their investment program:" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do is not quite clear: once he says," The minimum wage must rise, "he says, he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is about boosting growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics believe him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks inquisitively into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled briefly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor of social relief supplies in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are slaughtered.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentral accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened up the establishment with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors either.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women, other reasons for escaping:" many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"they have experience in their home with sexual violence, forced marriages, murder, slavery, or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that when they come to Germany, the end, Bahr recounts."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about what they experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know to help, there are more accommodations only for them, demanding Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for instance, there is no such thing in accomodations of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, in some community shelters there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be kept separate from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" "it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy, or if men and women are accommodated together, it can come to - perpetual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"most of all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is included in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read by the crowds, which there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have been around, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">The assistance doctors called on their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more competition measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had missed appointments to deal with the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who had been published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" persistently kept "problems, which led to the rejection of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted in favour of completely rejecting the proposed new treaty and requesting official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile appeared narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was daunting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin said and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, as it was done by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousins will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one point, it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his ministry last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vejsti says:" tourists there, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, as it looks at the response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge about the snail-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool sentiment and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an" alliance of outsiders "to Russia and Turkey: two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated, and are now united."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents stated at the press conference that they did not even stride the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will at least speak with one another."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that later he was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will resign on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president can suddenly run on Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - troublesome post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV received the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached the power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another of Putin's closest allies, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the North deck of the Queensland crossings with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing of the" "deck blower", "which approach the completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown approved the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is future-oriented high and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the country side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern train bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massively since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building up-to-date apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens say: investors should be taken much more seriously in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">"how do you react to the bad news, that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "Action Plan Home" "at the next council session."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation has been missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said SPD group leader Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: if anyone wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be issued as social housings in future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is as viola:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban residential building program, which will cost millions of dollars and needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Brandmann says:" there is no agreement between the factions at the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, as violators, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is underway."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of more than 1,300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be bought out pending bonds from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back to the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of the year, there are periods of time in the western city."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, the aim of the so-called mixing-mix is to be removed."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke writes:" "the CDU must be in the boat for a broad majority."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a Hunt for Health and Happiness, worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go out with their smartphones out and look for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" photographed "(using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the delusion and leapt for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person restores each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "30 minutes to come from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day" "hit deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as usual, there are also grumpy game perks that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="9">And now also the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast rang the competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five clubteam mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallion Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles turnt on the suspended beam during the single multi-fight campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman, who wins a competition title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou bailout she said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-fight campaign of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi."</seg>

<seg id="24">"this girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman."</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture deceives."</seg>
<seg id="27">Suspended beams and floor urns - in which Biles holds the world title.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she again picked up again with 15,433 on the float beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still put one on it."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her indignation - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, called Grandma by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her exercise, she threw away the crowds, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old boy was shot."</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">"grandparents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="5">"he has done a lot, his little body was perforated by balls," "said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the transmitter."</seg>

<seg id="8">The boy's family shared the transmitter with the fact that he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turning and for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kobe, who is a Catholic, rounds out, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see trainers in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same road as Aly and Madison to make it the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and turner primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competitive and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastic and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in prosperous suburbs to support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to enable the assemblies to be inspired by innumerable young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access sports training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnfoundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastic that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team golds and thanks, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance doctors who voted in favour of a vote rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt's plans were unveiling the agreement and said that the NHS would be in a" No Man's Land "and that any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistance doctors will receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend stays, in order to improve the maintenance of time-care times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance Bets announced last night in a message:" "assistance doctors still have serious concerns regarding the proposed treaty, in particular that it will heat the current workforce crisis and adore it to just treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes caused by discussions were to take part in the government for the reluctance to participate and sometimes listen to ear-deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">"this was the case of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month, that his door would always stand out."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, raise the vibration and address the concerns of assistance doctors."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if he does not do this, the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further training measures."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included in order to provide physicians on the strip chain cover."</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the BMA wants a better weekday remuneration for the 54.000 assistance doctors, which are subject to the contract."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Employees, called on the assistance doctors to end the strike."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "competition measures achieve nothing but little, but already strain overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, carers and their families only worries, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">"over the last two months, we spoke to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that continuing positive engagement to other important topics - such as sending, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutning Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being ignorantly ignored in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral fraud due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and local government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off bands outside electing cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry out an identification with them in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must merely call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes that non-removable ink can be applied to the finger of a person if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions on non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for election fraud, but should also protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Luton Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the Muslim duty of Muslims to elect him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person is chosen as someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm in the fraudulent correspondence with which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding leaks to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" as proof it was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the Elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists work on lettubings to stop" harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choosing voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure that they are randomized.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for automatic correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit full letter elections and envelopes from letter elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up shut-off for electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a change of law, which facilitated an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983."</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing prohibited in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters are alone in the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it" amazing, "that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral tribunal has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "checkups" "of the election registration departments of the town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud heir as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when you are approaching from behind you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the shot," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then beat him with his knee in the groin and twist, while the attacker is committing before pain, the weapon out of his hands. strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on it."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the cast line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller pulled down his immune system and thepheraliser of a serious test - by leaning out some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knock of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing each object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea to lick the rinsing knob of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public roads to stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitely under a test"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was definitely justified by his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test line showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Dairy Products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says:" that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D. in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the meaning of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things that I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social apartment after a delogition with a £50,000 loss, because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls cleared holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider because this property is thought to be considered as not such a beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, addictions of residents, drug abuse, trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and curses."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police to be invoked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing made her and her partner violent from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogition was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to Hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't bother anyone. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the village house trash and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the renter admits to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a delogiment is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their acts had to be terrible for their neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogition on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon got a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a drug of class B in trade-law.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will deluge renters who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow by the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that the delogition was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without reproach, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary reported that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, left a urine test under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Roter in the Olympic village."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the Kenias team leader by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the IAAF world association has asked the IOC to provide information about the case in order to exert their own investigations, and shared an IAAF speaker."</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IOC, the IAAF will review an assessment," stated it in an IAAF explanation. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago, her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from the east of London went into an airplane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Harry Reid, leader of the democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he was expected to select "Garland" with a certain amount of certainty.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a spokeswoman of Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton, if she would nominate Garland and he speculated."</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not care for unrest with a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="2">"those who do not adapt to Erdogan, sit on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in short, the Kurdish congregation of Germany reckons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, even" some hundred thousand, "the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because of the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime combats minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president-president Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already migrated from the months of Kurdish strongholds with impunity, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the sheiled coup d'état, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that assimilates refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or driven out over the last hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also a CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">The chief of the group called for the Federal Government to position "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a witch hunt is held against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>

<seg id="20">"those who do not adapt to Erdogan, sit on packed suitcases, by the way also Kemalists and Säculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>

<seg id="1">"Mecklenburg-Vorpommern:" "going there where it hurts" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the state election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for more than so far, it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the most vacationers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the land day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems come about: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count towards the end, only work hard."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again had to pass an election campaign short of the people passing by."</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his position."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party ever since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is how strongly newbie AfD is cutting off, and what remains at the end of coalition dusts."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one can see from its large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chatts a bit with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise seering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We are creating this" "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations twice; Merkel's federal election district lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost-CDU renounces the usual campaign conditions on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, Kokert thinks, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noticed that on the land, it is crumbling the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely there in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert is also self-exposing:" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden wedding receptions, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is in stake, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in the opinion polls, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the 2011 election, the SPD had yet clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and transfer their election campaign largely to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the president, Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green election fighters embark on a search for domestic voters among the holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvt with a houseboat by the mecklenburgische lakes and also finds it beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Their impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30 in the morning and ending at about 20 o'clock, there is always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything a bit jagged," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the meeting is also commensurate for those responsible for construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of station entrances."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now move on both sides from Ofterdingen to the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transit traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," says the Vice President Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping things were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signposting."</seg>
<seg id="14">This led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franking.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not met, the assembly also called for the Mössingen vehicle."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant exceedances," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been slit.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that now the street is open for customers from Rottenburg."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has resulted in sales collapses at them, allows everyone to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are produced for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight decline", "but also admits that" "course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most striven streets are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly known as Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants had hit it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far above 50 per cent", "the sales revenue is quoted" far more than 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the road building has been" "thrown back" "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to discharge half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at all claims, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive up, it's also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"at the end of the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly screwed to laws."</seg>
<seg id="2">"following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalitionist say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are" "politically reasonable" "to the coalition partner, says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package."</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not overdemand anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also take part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, as Minister of the Interior, he was concerned with results and at a" recoverable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in response to the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, Maizière took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot has already been announced, announced, announced, that a new security authority to deal with the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor does the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will start a second attempt for proposals not made with the SPD so far: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," states the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing, which in any case has no chances with the coalitionist."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few new ideas are presented by de Maizière, too."</seg>
<seg id="20">They have some in mind: he plans rapid proceedings for deportations and more ways to incarcerate people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are deliberately picked up in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of tolerations for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse things worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to obscure their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally sanctified.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some still seem unenlightened and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the imbalance between tolerated, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes," "said de Maizière," "it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply dealt with could not be clapped even in times of election.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved tremendously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="35">"with regard to internal security, the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high level between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garnish dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the departments also demand a Burka ban and a reversal from the dual nationality."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for irreconcilable sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't hold anything from a return from a double-pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have concluded the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To replenish them is not sensible.</seg>
<seg id="42">And he has constitutional concerns with a Burka ban.</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is unconstitutional at all angles and whether it is actually" "reasonable" "for the coalitionist, it must still be demonstrated."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in what could cause a fight.</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the prior-year level."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the home market of Germany, deliveries decreased by almost a sixth."</seg>

<seg id="17">Sales of sales Fred Kappler continued from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"at this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5.904 million worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with a software exhaust gas test.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the course of retrofitting, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance."</seg>
<seg id="23">"after the changeover, the car manufacturer guarantees a" "guaranteed" "certificate, but I do not speak of a" "guarantee" "as it was called on Friday in Corporate Travel."</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason to be juridical subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the" Focus "reported, Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed last Monday VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>

<seg id="28">"VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from this will not be accepted," declared Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after retrofitting and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Volkswagen itself does not use the term" "guarantee", "as it was called in company circles."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the long term" warranty "Volkswagen is able to see the possibility that for example, for example, customers can come to a workshop for half a year after retrofitting - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"also in the interest of customer interest, it is important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the tape scandal, leads to uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was called."</seg>

<seg id="3">The German Banks Association speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: "normal savers would not have to fear" to pay penalties for their savings.</seg>
<seg id="4">"if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay 0.4 percent penalties."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-old men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hurry to comment under the pseudonym Non-Allemony Men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the widely discussed revival of records does not rely on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought a record recently are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record purchasers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I run in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray suit and stuffed wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something like:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I count from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford as they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records, are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25 working with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the youGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people usually have gotten rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business such as phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers received impetus from the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some music fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff member flirts from a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% possess a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I strove through a stack of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came in and said:" I don't own record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has an entertaining audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sextpacked pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but the psychological trauma is hard to imagine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more of a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she doesn't earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a depressed sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the note to mustering jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a dad and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research yielded that the results of YouGov fit, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumble through plates of Berwick Street and Sheets through plates while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who raises nothing to middle-aged men's shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to submit 72 provisional shops where people sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that hold a fire and sanitary risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were" absolutely understandable. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the rain was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matter for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids" Café. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" for these children a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants stated on Friday that the number of migrants living in the jungle-ager rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby ended on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medley of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the bucks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it might be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this conclusion will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wondering and allowed the attacks to bounce off GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, as Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with only four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a protracted chackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man-Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua had a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Nakarawa added a new song since the second, and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half."</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still cores."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sean sultans whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged himself and GTC kicked badly into the lawn."</seg>

<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown made the bucks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first rowing beat until the last, 220 hard drives that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>

<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.ter unwritten assignment, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of wild helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one who knew it as the coach who had not been able to survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risked."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, he is spreading everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances was the correct term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go back soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing on itself is already a challenge but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking morning with something more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" I was an emotional wreck this week. that may be a bit extreme, but it means so much. "</seg>

<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he's the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked myself a better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, stanning and glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "Stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from the green power supply are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Settlement in the existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity production for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">This will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our" "steel is future" "campaign this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets are also to be weighed down in the reform of the emissions trading scheme," "said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation was exacerbated when China's world's largest producer of producers threw massive steel on the world market in light of the weaker domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imported import duties have been imposed on the import steel effect; on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price of the price is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry Primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp finally did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers are still cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a brief upliftment in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in succession."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the coming months, the Association anticipates an increase in orders thanks to an improved order situation."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does a good job for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's room she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sang in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"at the same time, she does something good to her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly ask for their lungs are not so fast out of the powder in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Singing is an optimal hobby even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age.</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Party of the Seniors Organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, it explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers have long forgotten events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head also requires a special performance, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adjusting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially the elderly, who live alone, do so not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I take a long time for something, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who can hear when a tone goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, Seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, you can simply join in."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many seniors' choirs through the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chomphe also Austrian citizens are affected, it is still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as waste."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a life-life quarter."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, among them the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosives went up again, a further human being killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the beach of Patong, popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flowerbed in front of the territorial police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwestern coast and in Chomphe on the south-east coast caused several injured."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmetavee Friday morning before journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage that is restricted to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">One rather assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they have not been informed of the exact time and place."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on its homepage, is recommending the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathivat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihar and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need for necessary trips to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a big influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"said Junta boss and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, reaffirmed himself of having led the kingdom again to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, it is not possible for the military to get a grip on Muslim rebels that have been smouldering in the extreme south of the country for years."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records are not always determining the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia sponge so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte then became the viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his CV with a 48-second setback and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media described him as the "robel of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" well-being, "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run ensured media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the buoyancy from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a race over 100 meters of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at that time, Moussambani was fired."</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"as of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3.44 Euro for the area of the Neudorf / Reuth / Welsh area, 3.44 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a high-cost calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the Office of the Agriculture Office Kulmbach noted that for these sewage systems underlay had to run."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-covering basis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016 the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fees are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt pointed out, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage works of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period should also be excluded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as a result of the serious ventilation increase, Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with a very low wastewater attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water flow in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in spite of their age, renovation and repair expenses were also considerable in all three systems due to their age."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh ahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopez almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "the continued care and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period came to these extraordinary expenses.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still clearly below the current level."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully smashed.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of great entertainment costs, has been spared from the waste water facilities over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to stone houses, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will remain precarious after the view of stone houses, as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility station is not to be extended because these facilities are deficient."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-flowered, self-winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All disappearances come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, snapchat filters have criticised themselves in which they were accused of using the app black face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellowish. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was designed as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, who have experienced racism, recalled the filter of breaking clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decided to reject the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was" vulnerable and least said. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been moved to the extreme extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and Snapchats great audience of young people - who are different in race than their older counterparts - could assume more, sensitivity to expect."</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters produces an image that is insulting to a user," it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that racid controversies would reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership, and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a human resource manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu said she added to her Snapchat account and added," "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, adjusts Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed, a report committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Committee Committees, Secret Service Commitee and Arms Commites, reports on great discontent among Central Command's intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically blended by high-level CentCom units, regularly recorded a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on-site and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the Centcom range from the top to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors, an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before Congress were much more positive than facts," the report noted. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossules could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it's so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command was changing intelligence reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the intelligence community published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created a moderately restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of Adam B. Schiff's House of Representatives, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," "Mr. Schiff," "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "shamed the morals among analysts and gave excessive space for divergent opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the democrats announced that they had no clues to an intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon's General Inspector, who had been accepted after complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress's reports while investigating the General Inspector."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts at times have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions of the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes between more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, written a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker according to government agencies stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the oil refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these provisional refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the US won fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is pending"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after having fired three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American March team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember what ever did."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten."</seg>
<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will take the first and second place within their group from six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a little longer from the strong Dutch to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss over their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London Games in the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workaround in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rudder completely snatched around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a back-handle from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without any victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlon."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, might have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was perceived so vividly that many people I had interviewed did not know that it is a sport of the Olympics anyway."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had been an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit, that I am not an expert, but only a bonded enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending clash - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "Trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like" "springboard". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winner jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic program, they are rated according to version, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medal-hoping leaders must go further, faster, up and down in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented quest is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vault into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualifying and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympic-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be reached by the monkey and the objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to be corrupted."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the United States "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia intertwined?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months protests against the government shook the country, and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or jail, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Sevlim Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a visionally criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this fragile, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberal Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and be armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of extinction under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believed that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under one umbrella," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was sent to Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublicized illness in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia witnessed such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of polls protested, which apparently fed by the government according to the statements of analysts, and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopia's leaders praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But clearly this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is taking a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amorous city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, attacking his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification posed new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans "presidential candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellow campaigners, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of declaring statements that he might not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was calling back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump told him that he was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help weaken the statement, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism razzled down Mr. Trump as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, but later he explained," Of course, I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction occurs." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of resolving the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump reckoned with an even more corroborating tone as his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general tries to not apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump sums up his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable position to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hinterbänker, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"prior to the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of rushing around each of his words and being biased towards him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," They can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unfit for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north from its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things."</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are garnings like capers and sautéed onions."</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly."</seg>

<seg id="36">"indeed, the Owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for tasting with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient."</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faithful for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"its menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Suey" "was talking about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her newest co-operation," A decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag shows the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, careless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"ordered as the reporter hacker roast, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which is the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Counter grinning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the roads with which the country was about to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense issue," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole was considered a" "wonderful way to recycle food residues," "says Brickman, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixes were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also contains recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, budget economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - looked at the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" households "and to turn Pampe into delicious meals like creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebtier is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks have only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Grönland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates on a rich 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle marked by slowness, however, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least from a Greenlank, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already assumed that Greenland's sharks will be stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow motion measured them, when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks who caught the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye-lentils arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth, therefore, should lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search for larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lentile core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland harks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 centimetre-long Greenland-shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no accident that such methotalicules live above all in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönland wal, whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught up before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal emits heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives in danger and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources rather in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Hillary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015, which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in 2015, Clinton donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,3 million in speech recognition; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million to the publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</seg>

<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="7">"in a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, even though they are not obligated by law."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have declared a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they are on the train," wrote Clinton's election campaign helper Ian Slam on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democrats "presidential candidates."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump Special Advisor told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not completed."</seg>
<seg id="12">"mumps critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012, Mitt Romney, have already stated that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his funds for charitable organisations, his business and various other connections, especially with Russia."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Clinton has already jumped on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, prompting Republican Trump to publish his tax return."</seg>

<seg id="17">"in the election campaign, federal taxes have become an issue."</seg>

<seg id="2">The miners from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg along a four-day hike from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the ministrants in the next two years, the St. Anna district council has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations have been checked and one finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruenol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms went on their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Father Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and divided the Pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Muenster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrim's way started from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the Men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow embarked on the anchorage of his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hockey's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in which they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner put a qualifying round in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but Kenny brought the team forward, and Skinner kept it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, when Hindes went into a higher gear in order to slow down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked out from his position as BBC expert and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic medina and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hindi said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympiad again.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the bicycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he has repeated Hockey's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest."</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mileage."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on security."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification, when he called him functionaries to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Dest, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in a world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama in the background played out in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton technical director in April in the midst of sex and Mobbingvores and the retirement of variables such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy fixed for 20 years will take place in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"no less than 2,000 workstations - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effect as the melt pump consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Schmeling of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" hedging business, "which should have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will be contributing to the revenue in the business year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures prices for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that the value of the contracts had already been written down in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to make the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the enamel, or to guarantee the power supply to the enamel. ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still debated why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions prior to the potential closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland would consume about 900 megawatts of electricity per year around 900 megawatts."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that wouldn't be good for us as a generator," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the view brought me to tears," wrote Kendall. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), spiced reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"that's the cliché-ventilated plot nearly every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we forgot you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow at this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashian began with safety."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendalls's big sister Kim likes to see what the Vogue cover has dealt with (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the tome containing 615 pages of advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his cover-star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine continued to pass through the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were definitely more" celebrities, the modells "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga was honored."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners was always somewhat tense in the fashion world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator entered the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">"today, its successors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster."</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came to business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euros, fans can buy the equipment on the internet, but somehow they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the West pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"indeed, the new mobile phone could set a lot for that standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even accessing websites was possible via HTML browsers, though very slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smart phone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the market is dominating vendors that came a lot later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is for very many people everyday."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"some 1.4 billion units sold, on Samsung and Apple, accounted for 555 million units."</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrows, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlarging Heathrows is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be playing on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the two-fishers were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong with Heathrow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth, leaving a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and all the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"for companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockades on its desktop side, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding with respect to his advertisements in order to make it difficult to identify which part of the page is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams's spokesman wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her struggle has been underway between the time-breaking open source community and the converters since the invention of indicators blockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display loaders, almost four times as much in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues."</seg>

<seg id="11">"advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues, making Facebook the investment of such a step as rewarding."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" ad preferences tool "to give people more control over their targeted advertising."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook said that Adblocks would cause new filters to cause concern because they would block content on the site that are not advertising."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident took place on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman slept in the dark," in an act of desperation "on the streets and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, said the police, who prompt them and every witness of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"that's something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was called in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after crossing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street, absorbed the court."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the court found that the policewoman -- who responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a" completely unusual and unforeseeable situation, "said the judge."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">"scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, which resemble those of climate scientists."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once again have outlawed earth-like conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet slowly revolved."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to harbor life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exponentiates its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was supposedly habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans have evaporated and their water vapor has been blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help the astronomers understand why stars are rotating in the star-building to different rates, and in what context the rotational periods with the planet origin are standing."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other startips, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">Now they are the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak-rotational rates, these mature stars stumble in large amounts of constellations."</seg>

<seg id="1">"data claw: so perfide, hackers blackish their ransom"</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partly repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies had already achieved a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom is much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently monitoring a scary rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Klecturnski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks carried out quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptoise Bitcoin -."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is struck."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of patient records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," Kleczynski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the investigators of F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with blackmail users and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to earn more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decode free sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of only a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware extortion, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus supplier Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>

<seg id="30">"the so-called malware kits have been created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>

<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now well-known among many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations instead," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, depending on the type of data, damage potential is much higher than ever."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also take up entirely new targets on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerkonferenz defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could control a thermostat connected to the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Stay: tips against Sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning there is no more to think of sleep well before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep and over ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, says Hans-Günter Veß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what we understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an entry and transit disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people just feel sleepy as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleeping disorder is not rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially in a depression," "says Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are subject to one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a herniated disc can be ill, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to greet each other via everyday problems and worries, Weehub gives an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look very different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicine - classical sleeping tablets just in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, stresses that there is hardly any fallen sleep physician in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, you should first contact the family doctor if you suffer from sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in case of snoring with breathing difficulties, in case of daytime fatigue, sleeping-walking or if you do not find the cause of a sleep problem, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not have a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after gluing, you go to bed at a normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping places."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which you can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"keep in mind: regular bed- and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police is one of the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"when one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a frescoed kindergarten and a bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here until 2017."</seg>
<seg id="5">"however, in recent weeks article about this" trendy neighbourhood, "as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard procedure by the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go zone "for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrol for three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers moved away under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk vorm late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has drawn up three children here, are above all irritated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a" Kiez, "which demands police protection from vandaliating leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police put between home owners and their neighbours, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly all of the Mainzer Straße close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polls from all over the world in recent years: now residents from the GDR and former home owners share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can see them attached to windowed discs or freshly painted facades that have been thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences, such as bodily injury, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences make material damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is weightless: people in the 94 are their neighbors, who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer moved consciously to the Rigaer Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it was therefore important for her to get back home: from the police, politics and media, which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not as good as they are," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for trailed ones who are annoyed by color bombs: the skin projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who pulls out should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can't complain about noise there."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine client of the working group points out that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the shameless fleece of wool, which has a problem above all."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less mocking rather than relying on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the passage."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administration specialist was sought out with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a shameless woolly sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not her central area," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are great and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers are standing in the laundry"</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time now, a serious problem has been to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must submit the refugees in their own or rented accommodation areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility shifts from the Board of Directors to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, management does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not working to rely on private apartments," says Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be restored as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers will be placed in the washing line."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master craftsmen, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"thus, administration and honorary officials also jump in here."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany, and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can easily bridge the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, may not work and is useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problem cases, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after the recent incidents fear radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine client quite clearly, "what some people might call naive." "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would make them completely callous.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary ambassadors have to look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">It is always in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics are afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are about 100 people at present, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
