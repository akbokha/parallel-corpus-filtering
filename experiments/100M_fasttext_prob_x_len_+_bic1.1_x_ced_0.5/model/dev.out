Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t exactly friendly .
they both wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and deplo@@ ys Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated further .
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partially regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel was rejected . &quot;
in an emergency call he conf@@ essed to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat hes@@ it@@ ant voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ st and a hand@@ written note , which was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi already taught 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous emergency at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life , when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ st died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended classes of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee him an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he received a doc@@ torate in education in spring .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar play . &quot;
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for some time .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ sh when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago both on a summer vintage .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ st Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was the president of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee . &quot;
&quot; at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ sh as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;
ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal employees as last year , but toy and baby products dealers say that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business gets closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox v@@ ex@@ ams about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated man@@ y@@ aw@@ n and an ar@@ mes@@ ial length of being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , together with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity to tackle the crisis in Syria that they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( still ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start asking seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom won even a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump sum fortune and start dropping their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
d@@ umps and r@@ ump ratings have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; upset , &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say they are &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see m@@ umps in temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters are getting used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their teachings , repub@@ lican voters are Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four of ten end July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination of only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can view Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump kno@@ cks almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to d@@ umps lead , while the anti @-@ drop@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump picks up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of margin Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly entr@@ en@@ ched their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; however , m@@ umps is strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign against immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; two months ago , the immigration of the pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ critical His@@ panic @-@ Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to be doing too . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they &apos;re also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter costs the most . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , one of the prices seems like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate Service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double tor@@ tu@@ ce in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller blessed the FC Bayern the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ re@@ aus .
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their tournament play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G√∂tz@@ fri@@ d ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start of the series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ote to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th consecutive hits of the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership , M√ºller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich holding word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top class , including rep@@ utable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts they were often too imagin@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were introduced too often by a game shift on Link@@ Sau@@ ge Douglas Costa , which was rare against O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
M√ºller had more luck on the right when his flan@@ k was kno@@ cked out of the right half field in the left upper triangle .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in the first half were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Der St√ºr@@ mer Brown beat the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct delivery , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; but Manuel Neu@@ er , a go@@ al@@ keeper , was leaving . &quot;
&quot; for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ leg@@ ged chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , said the sports officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at Sky : &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; G√∂t@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made it clear 13 minutes later . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ allen . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans obviously provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with whi@@ st@@ les against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when it comes to ren@@ unciation , the risk is reduced quickly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed over 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the relationship between smoking and tooth loss goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ kel@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , said director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health until high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of lack of denti@@ stry affected the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet the remains of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a specialist for Arch@@ ae@@ ological soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now been successful . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , probably belonging to the church . &quot;
young woman caught by freight train
&quot; after a young woman arrives at the train station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; , &quot; the Federal Police asks the population for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ pm , the woman crossed the track towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the acquisition of the train , it carried heavy injuries by the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated as a doctor on the spot and brought to hospital by rescue personnel .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence to the medi@@ ating officials . &quot;
the incident could possibly have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard of acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; the residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ wer@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ stra√üe and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Stra√üe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

EU Commission propos@@ ing new trial in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function equ@@ als significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens dare to trust , &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m responsible for the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de introduced the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is set to emerge with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries to equal parts . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , and there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to their own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism , over which companies can lead to damage compensation for tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act submitted the proposals by the European Commission to be inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of the reform , the Commission took into account essential points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ str√∂m &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
originally a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about different places , which he records on the map again and again , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they were created and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; they appear clever@@ ly composed songs , which blend harmon@@ ically very closely to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can easily drift into the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .
his guitar and ban@@ jo satisfy him live .
&quot; a year later , the musician , who lives in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) will appear in 2005 . &quot;
with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not listed in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic fragments . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; since long ago the smaller clubs sprang up , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger more !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without paying a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;
&quot; only an en@@ core says St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows to thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s d√©@@ but is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming session with suspen@@ se &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire and for the first time , with David Cameron . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after mid@@ day whereby his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment she will become a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday provoked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several titles of title in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , attracted attention &quot;
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Program , advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve the leadership of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acks &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limits of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions government said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of ¬£ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory boss over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ gil@@ ity is too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; and strike with re@@ tain@@ ers and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle is the shadow of economic minister when he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is on the go abroad .
&quot; he also had the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy show &quot; , &quot; often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire . but a few years later he admitted he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the interview with the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound asc@@ ended to data , indicating an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings grew by 2.@@ 9 % in the United Kingdom versus the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est assessments on the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 by 0.@@ 84 % compared with the euro . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling stock as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sold his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased 3.1 % , after the sports training company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages can je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese to potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ eters ?
&quot; both - in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger tak@@ eover owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served in its shop , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the idea of the Lebanese patent office in Munich has changed . &quot;
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash launches campaign for soil resistance to combat ageing inf@@ estation
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches off an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground tracking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia , ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much stake in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to approximately 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and remove all existing players , but mainly independent retailer sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers might lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said that the loss in the food and food business and the amounts of Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million before interest and taxes . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent Roy Morgan pol@@ l found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told about a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ √¢ s food and food trade , which accounts for about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler has , however , resist@@ ed and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores thanks to fast growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beaten Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ ing beat a potential US Open Vic@@ tory from Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite ex@@ iting about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a thu@@ g out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he adap@@ ts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not to all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a No Man &apos;s Land and re@@ acted by Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ visi@@ veness . &quot;
some referred back to protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels no joint immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the l@@ ump@@ y Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would finally receive a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on the swift action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency state , which was launched on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in opposition to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into effect at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation resulting from mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Government spokesperson Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still approve the military use of the military , which is expected next week but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days already . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that the authorities informed 45 people trying to cross the border , fifteen others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of com@@ mitting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are here to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to squee@@ ze themselves there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to get in , but thousands remain outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continued to hold a two @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ on for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a major advantage among the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if nominated by the party .
&quot; one quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about one @-@ quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and elec@@ torate will also be cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president poses a potential for the president &apos;s office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the prim@@ aries , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm . &quot;
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos; followers say that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
&quot; Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead against S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features among voters of the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , most of the Democratic Cho@@ ices of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , over six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times inquiry .
&quot; meanwhile , half of voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others are losing momentum . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters continue to support nationwide tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted last month ago by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son declined from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups , and tr@@ ump is sur@@ passed among repub@@ lican voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump much before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a look at a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearances in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water . &quot;
a dip in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; hot sum@@ mers , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it gets even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five Brotherhood members loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack loaded with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fa@@ inted and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the National Pres@@ idents of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Poli@@ ak@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide stuff and set the good of the Brotherhood basically over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Poli@@ ak@@ ef Wagner said . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended charges of murder of the third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of victi@@ mi@@ zed attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the land@@ se will be shaken , loans for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance for the process . &quot;
a recession came within 11 months of the first interest rate rise and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inv@@ ari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , net interest rates can make things more volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for asset income to be di@@ gni@@ fied 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after the F@@ ed rate increases . &quot;
&quot; in more detail , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , Head plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on return starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a rate rise of the F@@ ed .
&quot; since 1950 , according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP has been less than 4.5 per cent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; advertisement In such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; If it is different this time , &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants set themselves on a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade only gives 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions posted very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this date has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the inc@@ eption cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer bond between longer and shorter loans and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones writes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the dollar &apos;s strength and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve has increased , lending margins have increased , and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational corporations with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and also finance their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively to three months after an initial increase in interest rates , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analysts said in a report to the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed average growth of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital margins and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher earnings , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading Member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something what the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC Director General rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it would be harder to work harder to get the audience involved than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose on slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the start of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now indications that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , then it has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will probably experience that growth will decrease . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the wan@@ ing sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases in front of this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , in which the shop@@ pers fought for bar@@ gain , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from doing shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 pounds spent a little more than ¬£ 1 online .
&quot; in some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online , rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts a burden on the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed , as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , imposed a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mos@@ h of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the p@@ addle will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
&quot; king Sal@@ man said today , the Bin Laden Group should not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company foreign trips was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the wre@@ ath , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which was later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also charged the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive building project , which is managed by the Bin Laden Group . &quot;
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4.000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of that amount .

&quot; it is claimed that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men carrying out the work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are skill@@ fully b@@ yp@@ assing walls with a hammer or brush , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY store chain , said that a big increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry told her that she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten shop decisions were made by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
she said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance management . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court K@@ lagen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball championship A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 the defend@@ ants used mon@@ ies from association accounts on which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was divided by the Chair@@ person of the Sch@@ op@@ ener sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point in time an asset portion was created . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials reck@@ oned only expense damages and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities weighed around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread @-@ based corporate audi@@ tor of the financial department . &quot;
&quot; with his co @-@ workers and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take on this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , if the financial success is appropriate , the reimbur@@ sement of reimbur@@ sement of expenses was resolved by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus on the account had been paid . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , flat formwork and non @-@ detailed accounts appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and the accounts kept the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial services , it was important only to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
the defend@@ ants declared that this was a set@@ back .
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally thought , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room . &quot;
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed that the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; &quot; claims settlement &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned mil@@ eage and diets . &quot;
&quot; he charged 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
accurate documentation for the early years could not demonstrate the accused .
&quot; they were no longer kept after an operational check , in which everything had been properly evaluated , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage .
&quot; all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his hom@@ etown of international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff reduction that has been ongoing for three years , the computer can reduce further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up . &quot;
the positions of the HP @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs should be saved in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has grown up with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split up : so the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo recently .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under ‚Ç¨ 25.@@ 4 billion .
this resulted in a decline in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting up and massive positions on the change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company , under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man , re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected : 54 per cent voted against it , 35 per cent agreed . &quot;
61 percent of other countries fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a collaboration with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad rej@@ ecting 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
&quot; car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show , IA@@ A &quot;
&quot; the main focus of the fair is on the 27th of September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
&quot; as before two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA car association reck@@ on with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used tear gas at the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ chers for several hundred refugees .
European Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he told by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a wat@@ cht@@ ower was ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials . &quot;
the officers initially used pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; now , the refugees have withdrawn something . &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
other refugees stuck together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Ser@@ b police press spokes@@ men also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
the time of deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is observed when the US bank note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historic event because it is seven years since F@@ ed has started interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may abandon zero and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 GMT on Thursday
&quot; death cont@@ ingent at Delta State University , left par@@ ap@@ hr@@ asing letter &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Som@@ e@@ one shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; lamb told the staff of the emergency department , that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb carried 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt too , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ st had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter , &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb had ph@@ oned up relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , Lamb went his car to the side , ran away , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University as well as his li@@ fest@@ yles on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that have lost their luck charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros each year alone with a better organization .
&quot; in 150 of the around 1,000 senior executives worldwide , the restructuring will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot &apos;s union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of real@@ ignment was to generate earnings of around ‚Ç¨ 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no board for Lufthansa in the future for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphasizes the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company will in future want to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict of collective agreements with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the judi@@ ci@@ ally scheduled strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that is what the union shared with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; cockpit wants to achieve results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the drivers , the &quot; Wings &quot; austerity concept is in the background . &quot;
it fores@@ ees that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitor routes is transferred to the company &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this brought the left external defender to tears and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from playing , Louis Van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; He has a double leg structure and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United is very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli the refer@@ ee has not pun@@ ishable the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was saying , &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now starts , I get stronger again . &quot;
this relates to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat of PS@@ V
the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves room with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ ter by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; surely David Cameron , The Lor@@ ax , knows better ? &quot;
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a child care provider to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 , chose Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental policy . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all well and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead ren@@ ders a summary of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the heart of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the history of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he states to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circular .
&quot; Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; b@@ umping Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England chose for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude an ou@@ tri@@ ght victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry any s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss thank@@ ed his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and it doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to go home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a hit man I treasure . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave mos@@ ques in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and would receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s devil of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques might not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns straight away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he was very impressed by me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ a , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , since he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;

&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not set the schedule . &quot;

such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of the UK from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a dol@@ drums by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with each passing day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on their own , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive coven@@ ants that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and George Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to look outside the UK outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long har@@ assing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain is on the left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately refrain from any helpful remarks , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be , and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the 1975 referendum , but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ hack@@ ed foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that when you sit in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having dinner and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Camer@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly tap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems to be in danger N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s to repeat a mistake back then and today .
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;m kind of friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blo@@ oming trend and the wild bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness may well say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70@@ ies when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their convention on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the blu@@ eg@@ y bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even stir@@ red up - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with lowering the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday , what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; statements made by a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) closed up Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month , describing him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi@@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the Refer@@ ences of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International according to reports beforehand . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes @-@ champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; stands in evidence &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products in most of the criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alle@@ gations of p@@ he that &quot; there has never been evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smoking dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear understanding of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programme is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts give what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like East@@ erin . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the public , but they meet their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio service , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee for the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course you all think , we all think that one gets a lot of money here for 150 ¬£ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the ¬£ 150 , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of her TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she was supposed to take an example to the public television stations in Australia and Canada , for example , &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they reson@@ ate with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; impulses work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to support the membrane duc@@ ts responding to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the method of one day could replace deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; round@@ worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and can be found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the dice cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets commuters on the underground .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works for char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free . &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons fair - through a laying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ eli@@ ac corporate advertisement , but &quot; through the inv@@ ading with bright colors and animation , it remains strong . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I stum@@ bled -- and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student halls ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in terms of cor@@ by@@ n and why you are honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recipes , movie night events venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and get their under@@ wear . &quot;
related : don &apos;t remember getting to university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I &apos;ve consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos of kno@@ cking : do it .
a fellow in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
&quot; as you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a little bit like that , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken are a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a washing liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if it was something to make Drum &amp; Bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more lu@@ ke@@ able music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour check . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and perhaps witness how they all come across all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left its keys in its not locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good punch is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , then put them in the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single persons , low ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses in Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in an interview with the 44 @-@ year @-@ old , &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed into the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space over the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a House of Rei@@ men needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : under construction law , I have properly tigh@@ tened my project . &quot;
especially complicated it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the set @-@ place ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;

and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were those who accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seekers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable homes ?
&quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : true , we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but they were built in luxury con@@ domini@@ ums that hardly could afford more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app , type &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to get around the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by installing the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch off half @-@ way and this could lead to a crash of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure that you &apos;ve reviewed our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and protect themselves , if they do it . iOS 9 brings new features including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system . &quot;
Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup second stressed that I had nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up world champion ahead of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .

&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate play@@ - and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen at K@@ ur . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz first class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which chairman Alfred Klein met . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is possible to record chess players who cannot open the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent for talent should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
neighborhood office looks for direct contact
the Anton@@ in Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ in Alten@@ Centre have gathered under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened up a new focal point at Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation goes down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and seeking advice receive information on questions such as health care insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been using our out@@ patient care service to ensure that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; the new owner , Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ in and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; explained the complexity of insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both business leaders look forward to demographic change . &quot;
this is because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot;
this gives the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 . &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away at the age of 92
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnstler@@ haus on Tuesday hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnstler@@ haus granted an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called in the outside . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology during and after the Second World War with Friedrich Leh@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 80 &apos;s , he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only after that , I decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , was followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the group was located at the altitude of the b@@ ft petrol station . &quot;
there were also three people staying at the gas station .
one of these men scre@@ amed the young man and hit him face with his fist .
the victim here suffered from the nose of the nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car right up to the apartment and passed it demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a head@@ stock , one las@@ hed on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
&quot; until now , there is only a vag@@ ue description of the tat@@ too . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ atories to contact us at phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ eck Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , there are no doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ is@@ ausen on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side with half a job in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , M√ºller will open the office on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently has completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ dener hospital and also wants to get into practice next year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the idea of the married couple M√ºller was to pursue their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller . &quot;
we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
and so they agreed that the land@@ fills bought the house with practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is honorary member of the DR@@ K @-@ willingness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the M√ºll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a hous@@ eholder . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the land@@ fills receive a grant of a total of 50,000 euros in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2,000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ is@@ ausen every quarter , in the north German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; if there was no successor , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos; consultation hours , by the way also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ ce@@ aus@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell at A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen with a smile . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , they already feel a little sad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and we will see many patients still often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to submit an asylum application can , of course , make it &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and could also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border , especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to limit its borders to refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to pass the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly hitting the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country has about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would agree on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to make people aware of certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the early morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were on the way all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said to us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could now indeed come to a slightly further west @-@ west route to the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already predicted by observers . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good report to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to continue their journey to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic appe@@ aled Wednesday morning at a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn into Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians worth 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who is accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ eers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; thus , according to the investig@@ ators , more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says it in the SE@@ C notification . &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
&quot; ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid , Mannheim , has existed for 20 years &quot;
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their err@@ ands , partly fast steps , partly comfortably stro@@ lling . &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car terminal at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city railways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life in glorious autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four big boards each with the head@@ line &quot; &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid drew attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ant spontaneously resor@@ ted to chal@@ k and the phrase &quot; &quot; be@@ j@@ ah@@ en &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; can read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end will come to me , I can live in a responsible way , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim &apos;s Di@@ ak@@ onic work , which is shared with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Associ@@ ate of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people . &quot;
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mourning companion is one of the honorary members of the first hour .
&quot; faced with the subject of personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid searched for an honorary am@@ nesty , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
all are well trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ p , hold it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health funds and donations from relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the deaths and mour@@ ners .
&quot; every two years , training for new employees will be offered . &quot;
&quot; the tablets , which are described on Saturday , are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; there , more personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed and financial outlook reduced for 2016
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his profit prospects for a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected 10.@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower outlook is despite the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent above average , and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher ground transport of heavy and large pack@@ ets , which will be lifted from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves solid earnings when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts at T@@ ack Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased 5 percent to ‚Ç¨ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts questioned six of Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has experienced a decline in international priority shipments , which generated sales in its unit Express shipments to stagn@@ ate . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenues owing to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the interest rate for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening about them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled with unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and even by one @-@ quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ as , head econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do to uns@@ ett@@ le the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones achieved an average of 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase of the proposition expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % below its peak in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market recovered slightly this month , whereby the Dow is now almost 10 % below the May of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when the interest rate should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins during this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to better handle the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authorities . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , b@@ anded confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor developments elsewhere , but are also advised by other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . , is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ner , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated a rise in interest rates , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite the limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives returned these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are getting upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;

&quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The original . &quot;
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; even with her 74 conferences , she still enjoys teaching . &quot;
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Street . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite a different lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazilian p√§@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding nutrition
&quot; the Brazilian p√§@@ di@@ at@@ ric Organization SP@@ RS tries to uncover women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with presenting pictures of babies , which su@@ ck on breasts with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects pregnant women in fact affecting the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around building at the Bern@@ ese Sport@@ park is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council session , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the committee had already approved an application for a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ central first and roof@@ top &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; the roof til@@ ting , which for energy reasons - was dict@@ ated differently than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; concerning the ti@@ lt - whereby the Bern@@ ese community council is usually rather restric@@ tive in terms of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , turn@@ around building is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the sports hall building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next stage of the proceedings , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Board of Directors for the examination . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the staff train from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; this is what the surprising plans of the hospital of the Land@@ kreis before , the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board and will meet next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who cannot go to Sch@@ on@@ gau will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play who agreed to take over the line from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ on@@ gau with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; over the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to take both houses if the Supervisory Board agrees to maintain both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ours that the House , owned by the Federal Reserve , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say that there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ time sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity would not come back , &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as head physician for more than 30 years , I have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .

Jag@@ dun@@ ce with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( County Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly the accident could occur was unclear at first .
the Criminal Police estimate .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
&quot; a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youngsters were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who was missing since Saturday , fell victim to a violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old captured on Tuesday evening is considered to be an active agent who , according to the fact , conf@@ essed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after it had not come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities claimed that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the body in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be scre@@ ened to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death . &quot;
the further investigations are intended to provide information on the circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights at the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable homes , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ time accommodation . &quot;
many then stum@@ ble across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were living in the last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing development policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently some 77@@ ,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study . &quot;
many working people therefore lived in large towns not only in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market , young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has been declining for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; thus , the real estate tax would be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be temporarily suspended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters by the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , ‚Ç¨ 18@@ 4 million had already been retri@@ eved by more than half of the available 300 million euros on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free rail : Croatia and Slovenia address a corridor
&quot; in Hungary , there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Ministry of the Interior and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot;
&quot; after the closure of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to travel from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; moreover , new laws that came into force on the same day make public asylum procedures virtually unnecessary in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic announced : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this eventu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
&quot; most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot;
&quot; after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closing of the door on Monday , there were 9@@ 380 places . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws instruc@@ t the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
&quot; in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 pen@@ al procedures were initiated . &quot;
the convic@@ ted are threatening prison sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the asylum seekers who have rejected asylum should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
the shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities . &quot;
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot . &quot;
&quot; mayor continued &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; across the border &quot;
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had unexpectedly cancelled the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we first used the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said right away , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire department .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; Stad@@ ler said . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was put down in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably organized a two @-@ wheel@@ er run on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n is sending tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially put the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude into the sphere of national socialism . &quot;
&quot; speakers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; the refugees too must find that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers in the face of ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof districts &quot;
&quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has all the hands to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former massive Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to issue lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already managed to get a grip on the chaos in the original Tra@@ is@@ kirchen trial centre .
&quot; we don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without a fuss , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a need of 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ish year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 apartments have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already talked with the provincial labor@@ ers .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s going well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator has also met great expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; &quot; campaign . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can offer accommodation easily . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it is not possible for the host to comply with a certain amount of the size of the towel rack or the size of the tor@@ so . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was successful in placing more successful , based on his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic any costs , as they stated themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , the own quest for districts has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are obviously problems with permission . &quot;
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently under no control of these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the city chief critic@@ ises the partition of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday recorded further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
the fact that now Austria also takes control of its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; for P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger from the action of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ park has been officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T has moved in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later acquisitions .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is owned by one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter rest area in the building is already rented , for another 40 per cent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gain an increase in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags made by the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been reconstructed . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking for a long time whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the great region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been put in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the latest security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is re@@ used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
some people also associate with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; as regards foreign hos@@ tility , journalists are concerned or un@@ aware of knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well with it .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the p@@ am@@ per@@ ing hair@@ cut is a word for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related to over -@@ zig verti@@ ces with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the city rider Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film over Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they somehow find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous s@@ ap@@ lings , to which beside Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dently loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the geber , she says . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the country in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once he@@ wn apart without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he says , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a new@@ born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the American win@@ emaker tends to distance himself from the Americans , &quot; he is always so u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous . &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the pension mist@@ ress Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ in a visit , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump for a long time , has seen 12 000 movi@@ ego@@ ers , also in the US is awakening interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
&quot; the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , set up in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the uprising did not seem to play a r@@ √¥@@ le for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five main cities , in comparison to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday &apos;s ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today we closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , Today , on average , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently wit@@ ched father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached an impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ael Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 bis 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in an average 44@@ 6,000 audience . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 5 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to rush the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery to be revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally ends up with Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was kept in great sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you might accidentally have an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become per@@ ni@@ cious who won the heart of the bach@@ elor . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
&quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment I went home and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noted , I felt that they were fairly compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood is &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired for him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the lef@@ to@@ ver girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team he encouraged them .
&quot; in his press conference , Hay@@ nes publicly reinforced Hay@@ ne in his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers sport re@@ porter Zel@@ in@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens once , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ n . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport made his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters call for the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Gro√ü@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get lost in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the free elec@@ torate conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UNO protective zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Yugosla@@ v wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we need to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed the fact that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need uniform federal standards for federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in the city of Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long lasting torch remains on the agenda : education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the pilot phase &quot; &quot; middle @-@ stage plus &quot; &quot; at 47 gym@@ nasi@@ ums , where an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um from three to four years is tested - in the result it takes nine years up to the final ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; however , Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough . &quot;
&quot; the issue G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all the grammar schools we want .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump
&quot; the German stock market concluded , after a long @-@ distance , trend @-@ setting and nervous trading process with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a strong start of the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

solid gains also made commercial seats in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index also noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many B√∂r@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to take place until after the interest in the US and also to the big decline on the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday .
&quot; the debate about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed RW@@ E &apos;s shares down to record low , and left deep marks also at E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack ‚Ç¨ 30 billion in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures stated in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Da@@ x peak , Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors presented little attention to the German chip maker . &quot;
investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold more than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers by car manufacturers Daimler and BMW rose by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen &apos;s assets were ad@@ jour@@ ned by 1.@@ 26 percent .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the ru@@ pe@@ e district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , while some of you threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the site at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
no contracts had yet been concluded .
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner Gro√üe Stra√üe , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning for a holiday home on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are more worried - they fear selling off their free time fu@@ gi@@ um
&quot; for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday home on the Little Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective client , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , who repro@@ ached the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ased went on to the offensive by the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; for months , this project has been in the debate about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; violent reactions among sal@@ tw@@ ater owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details about the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ump that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he is also afraid of several other project critics that the transport would increase strongly by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ loads , so that it pays off &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what happens exactly on the one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the construction plans are still variable . &quot;

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations @-@ call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who has fled Kab@@ ul with her family , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for obes@@ e diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan , Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , used data that they collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes @-@ disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general were better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , write researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the ga@@ stro @-@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and recorded more complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study showed no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we will wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly in school hours , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is glad that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide called for an end to the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama advoc@@ ated Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s acting after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase in suspension of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swallow strong alcoholic drinks such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reported by poison control centres , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products and , regre@@ tt@@ ably , a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said some children want to intentionally drink dis@@ infection products while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mutation in the social media . &quot;
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ infection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in infants , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let go of si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry du@@ oden@@ al disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally regarded as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah urged her words and was not able to walk as she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and turned his head , &quot; &quot; said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; gem@@ m@@ ful &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
&quot; the police looked at the ver@@ dic@@ ated plan as &quot; &quot; bab@@ ble &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authorities . &quot;

&quot; as a result , he bla@@ sted with his truck to the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle onto a standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; there was a damage of about 10,000 euros in vehicles involved in accidents involving the accident , the police reported . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers aren &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ √† . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ √† accepts that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss swe@@ ars to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; following the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now at the top of the table with a score of five points , followed . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ √† said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it just like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent of the U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cs Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I Bec@@ ome Wit@@ ness of a Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the crime .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who can contact you .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after wet police persec@@ uting persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade &quot; &quot; him sof@@ tly to return to the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a breach of house peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &apos; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
professional football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals for the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threaten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria had tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity section claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it went to the positive cobal@@ t test specimen at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held himself 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it went on .
&quot; sometimes one re@@ acts and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about raised heads , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
M@@ oo@@ dy had previously reported the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this make me think it &apos;s going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , called the racing treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack was applied mud or clay on the horse run@@ way , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on my leg . &quot;
it could have been like this last night .
&quot; it could have been like that yesterday , which was so . &quot;
&quot; it had , however , also on the day of the race . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an examination of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia appeared in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with assistance and assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back against ri@@ vals for claims about ring battle
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack of his crew and said they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers to his squ@@ ad was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s up and down again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring battles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or the techniques over the whole year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock to him . &quot;
it is funny how this always appears during this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; thrilling soccer &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St. George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are there p@@ auses , and there are no points of tension ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who may face a life sentence due to his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for attempting to own a commercial deal of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the caf√© could have been from a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a 200,000 dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driving cab apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
the crash maker &apos;s cab disman@@ tled completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; a damage occurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg &apos;s phone used by girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to call for images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep and was logged in to an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ interrupted images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it through , found the bewil@@ dering news and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used concepts for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches were carried out on the computer by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent photos on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; according to the indictment , Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to viol@@ ate un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the Court to attend a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defend@@ ant Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not to appear in the registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as it might be argued that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict up to October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was still included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
slu@@ ices devi@@ ate to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are attacked by the large @-@ scale control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad users left people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings due to fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts . &quot;
they were walking on the German side by foot over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion .
&quot; there , they will be met by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registry . &quot;
&quot; compared to the week &apos;s start on Wednesday , the Munich central station again met with much more refugees on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; there were about 700 people in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : sp@@ urs of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm bubbles in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the last days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance District , DW@@ D is expected to count from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun will last longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers at the IA@@ A show their innovations .
&quot; in 2015 , the compact car is particularly well @-@ known for its compact cars . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of all new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August , according to Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Pub@@ lication Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , a lot of new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; R√ºssel@@ sheim . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel gains a footh@@ old among the largest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is available from 16@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second version will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what about new compact cars next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor m@@ √©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and one accentu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s instructions at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
Bal@@ eno sales launch in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger stood on the front part of the front . here , the gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the open Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI appeared . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General , who was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the loose feet again , was moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office due to the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges lifted the judgment of the Kammer@@ gericht Berlin and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
court ruling now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation will be decisive for compensation , unless there was a claim for compensation , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a ham@@ mer@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
&quot; according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in the last weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines for lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , which rises aggres@@ si@@ veness , even in fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 shall fall in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that .
what is coming up in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years - are used . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments come out of the price bond , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments each year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) estimates that 55 per cent of the poultry slaugh@@ tered in Germany can be employed in the long term .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically sought after their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the support society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , &quot; said migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour . &quot;
&quot; while there previously was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence requirement , the asylum seekers are confined to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , too , due to the shortage of skilled labour , the way in which refugees should be allowed to get access to the labour market faster - also because of the shortage of skilled labour . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; up to now , there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is the king &apos;s way to integration into work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ned parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Co@@ libr@@ arian , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example , by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for the lessons . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was until now Berlin , inner Senator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position . &quot;
study willing to accept refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits after the asylum claim performance law , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ e , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to b@@ af@@ e . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span was reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this funding gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state churches have the right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic charity which takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights are also duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to accommodate religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be borne in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre and a general equality law since a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it slowly learns how the Nazi crime series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and why international tre@@ aties such as the Anti @-@ racism Convention Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says the president of the physician , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end the registration of health cards to all arri@@ vals . &quot;
the services provided could be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut off so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum claim law provides . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors above all make language barriers . &quot;
&quot; as early as so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , but also in doctors &quot; practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
but many refugees would also be helped with more general medical appointments in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ affected disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment . &quot;
&quot; with some of the other cases , German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some refugees even were doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; particularly vulnerable are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleep and concentration difficulties , strong sc@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; so far , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for a psych@@ otherapy application in the welfare offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , social workers or physicians who are not trained for psych@@ ic illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege is inviting you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sers and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick and was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current Man@@ e@@ gen stage . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift for fan@@ atics lies in the blood of the family . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the program of the Circus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo hopes to easily record it . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are very often subject to different animal protection organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each mat@@ ernity unit .
&quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
&quot; the first commandment , therefore , is to care for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid &apos;s jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the circus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; regardless of whether there are five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; from 17 to 20 September , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances every day at 5 pm and 8 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m .
&quot; Thursday is the family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen
&quot; last month , they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokesman for Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
it warns the members of parliament that immunity ends in the Parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job cuts result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as long as his rehabilitation is going according to plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain at the European Championship . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but how Wen@@ ger also recognized there is the associated danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different types of wild sh@@ ears since its debut six years ago .
he also played in 65 out of arsen@@ als 157 League games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 which have recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the risk of injuries will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team . &quot;
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow players who need it to get a little break &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Mr. Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as evi@@ den@@ ced by young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a miserable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that men are going to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental health friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on style and substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared that money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football watching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it anyway , even if they are often reluct@@ ant to explore fully their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y ministry explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone to help people in moments of desper@@ ation also may help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to comedy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to rent Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Co@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Co@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French masters on their way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ y@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a clas@@ se of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . that &apos;s why it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed to death in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm became known as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined with An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little to attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was p@@ atz@@ eted in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an finished his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c ti@@ pped up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ hand from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League match was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core raises 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the Swiss @-@ based mining giant , Gl@@ en@@ core , who is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday as part of its huge debt package . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately CHF 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn p@@ ushes demand and impacts on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores share price on trading in the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange .
&quot; share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares valued at up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on September 25 , promp@@ ting President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi &apos;s and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .

&quot; at a company in the Got@@ ha district , you can meet the dream and once rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 440 hor@@ se@@ power . &quot;
this was also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from Got@@ ha county .
&quot; on the A 71 in Arn@@ stadt , the dream came out and passed . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , caught on wet roads and drove to the guard rails . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league , four times champion league winner , two times champion league , two times champion league , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was standing before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ √ßa would sell me .
&quot; at that time , Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that , he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavarian playing time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film production
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a episode of Sunday night of HB@@ OS &apos;s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with ab@@ u@@ sive dis@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comment@@ ators of The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before condem@@ ning Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the motion Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content . &quot;
&quot; in February , singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums are still weaker , &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums always have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ises invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is not clear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which has just completed its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing was one of the 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; Isaac said ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll win any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the rolls .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for eighth season and filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; previously they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb up in one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two in@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in 1 / 3 in@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the pot@@ ency well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon gave his second bass driver Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run in front of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ffe managed a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth downtown , wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
but the right @-@ handed drummer S@@ ano out of three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the list of injuries prior to the game after he was missing more than a month due to a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , flus@@ hes left a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z set his 0 @-@ 21 hit series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not particularly well beaten , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ics right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
comment : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the throwing school .
&quot; he is resear@@ ched by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder joint , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the list of injuries to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who are enriched in it should then be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , just as the city of Wiesbaden was told on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital had been prepared for this event in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stop there . &quot;
they should then be distributed to other commun@@ es .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the presi@@ dency of the Government of the Government of H@@ esse , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , head of the Munich Security Conference , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed &quot; collective departure &quot; to the European states .
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict crashes on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive surge of international assistance to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , did not send back refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is so arranged , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee policy in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need protection would also complain . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a pencil @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also be blocked with a fence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot;
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungary &apos;s foreign minister to the planned new border fence . Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from crossing over Romania .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut through the fence .
in Turkey eye witnesses reported that thousands of immigrants were on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice cap of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sp@@ lashes .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this tum@@ ble movement is only small , but still too large for a non @-@ stop heavenly body , it is stated in a statement by Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) of Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; the extent of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 for several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen should ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis is expected to be &quot; &quot; planned for four weeks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber@@ y loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , goal hunter Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una D√ºsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on his head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a grave bre@@ ech . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged from them .
&quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. above all , however , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus supports the ey@@ esi@@ ght , the immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so , green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the US package service U@@ PS offers up to 9@@ 5,000 temporary hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA . &quot;
&quot; the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries submitted the package services harsh critic@@ isms . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ eh@@ ement , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ √∂hn stops in the valleys of the Alp@@ illes side of the F@@ √∂hn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz told on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows through the head pe@@ eler . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ √∂hn winds through the valleys during the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows in the usual valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ eh@@ n can pass through to the adjacent centre of the centre , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ ary arches of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my blow dryer makes for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow down at the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be counted in the south of the Alps . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning a cold front with strong , partially weather@@ ed rain rolls from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go down significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days show up in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it gets sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Prime Minister Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino a nam@@ eless spot in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
&quot; in the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied for by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes apparent that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a sin@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western church with his thes@@ es against the deal of indul@@ gence .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this may seem quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles developed that focus on themes such as cross roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or father@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and here is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible points . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into present @-@ day contexts . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; as early as the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to work this up in order to bring me to the Lord &apos;s father again and again .
&quot; his second aim is to restore the art of art again in the quick@@ est possible time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced there .
artists have another desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to be &quot; &quot; inv@@ ade &quot; &quot; the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was always &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t care to completely capture the Bible , but carefully selected the topics that were important to him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here are the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
&quot; plans made , place found , companies mand@@ ated to shape earth moun@@ ds for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finally over . &quot;
&quot; there were failures in politics and administration , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill brought up , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the First District Council , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , could now share in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year will still happen , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further pause &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga set a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football responds to the situation escal@@ ating in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of helping to cope with the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say that in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and may help .
but the crucial turn@@ out must be policy .
&quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its Refu@@ gee Initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; four years . &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 profil@@ ers set a clear indication if they will carry the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot market instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports chief Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fu@@ gi@@ tive drama is going on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot;
&quot; we have to be able to play football , no , we must use our bril@@ liance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Sa@@ tig was speaking of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their places would be great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already sum@@ med up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , fa@@ inted , then tow@@ ed out to the street - he told us last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October , and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to come to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it is important to stand up once you have fallen .

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 1 )
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus were finally crushed in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national team will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top Game against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load on its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Roman Catholic Roman citizens .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the So@@ ccer coach praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe @-@ League matches in the future , he left the door open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final turn for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl in comprehensible : &quot; that &apos;s not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robotic cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt talked to Frankfurt on the br@@ ink of the IA@@ A fair of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and take care less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who will also meet with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper by the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communications . &quot;
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to make sure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; are to be expected only a long way after 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD transport policy S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly defined . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still don &apos;t see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test gan@@ ization decree , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to take control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still imagine 15 percent , in traffic jams 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to control .

&quot; according to current status , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf wants to open only in a single position on the cover of the title battle from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision shall be made by the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said German coach J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf in D√ºsseldorf during the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor meeting in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became European champion . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , in the meantime it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the oeu@@ vre of the man who wrote fashion history , without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; the show is not built chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete piece of work for which much effort has been carried out : to fr@@ ot@@ ch the d@@ olls , a sty@@ list was specially hired for example . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to the cur@@ ator , made 14 tons of material . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as he told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later , I bought it , of course . &quot;
he couldn &apos;t pay the models for his first fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , the long embroi@@ dery engines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were made in large quantities for customers , who worked for example for blankets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Fashion Design P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early stages of the P@@ lau@@ dry peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt refers to some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that re@@ jects past styles is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who does not use any niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ dest@@ y P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker . &quot;
only they must wear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been cut away . &quot;
there is almost no more private business and wholesale .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as explained by C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outdoor office of the West@@ s√§ch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; a conflict of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies , which must think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow ball . &quot;
&quot; at some places , the machine embroi@@ dered small spheres . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe was inspired : &quot; &quot; previously I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now it uses the snow@@ ball tip for its jewelry .
&quot; in a costly procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; as a result , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends shall not be stir@@ red , but Disney still dar@@ es to have a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Board for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident milking system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved through test programs .
&quot; the initiative is important as it has a greater role in the market for allocation of resources , guarantees a rule of law and open the market more open , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are being opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and simpli@@ fying the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and therefore expect a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch &apos;s consumer organisation , which has a corresponding paper on the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already bur@@ dened with mercury today that on the basis of the still valid limit values , around 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ mis@@ e of Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal for humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish across the food chain . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; small quantities already can cause damage to the nervous system , particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values but that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
&quot; mercury reaches the environment , mainly through coal combustion . &quot;
&quot; according to a written report by the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations discharge more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently exceeded &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings about mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system . &quot;
