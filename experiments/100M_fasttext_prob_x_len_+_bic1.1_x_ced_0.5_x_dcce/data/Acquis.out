&quot; 2 . the list of the raw materials produced in paragraph 1 , is regularly updated according to the following mod@@ alities : &quot;
a ) The application for the inclusion of new raw material cali@@ bres in the list is directed by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the community or the local manufacturers of crude works to the Swiss C@@ lock@@ ers . the application is to add a technical description of the raw material cali@@ ber .
&quot; the Swiss watch@@ dog , or the new cali@@ ber , immediately carries the so @-@ called list . &quot;
&quot; if the inclusion in the list for a resource cali@@ ber has already been applied , which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the statutory technical control in Switzerland , the Swiss watch chamber can refuse acceptance . &quot;
B ) The re@@ patri@@ ation of the raw materials listed in the list shall be communicated by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the community or by the manufacturer who had previously requested the recording .
&quot; C ) If the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland are not authorised , the Swiss watch@@ dog may demand the filing of the relevant raw materials from the list ; it teaches the party concerned . &quot;

&quot; remember that after article IV paragraph 2 of the contract , all contractual parties agree to facilitate the possible exchange of equipment , material and scientific and technological information on the peaceful use of nuclear energy , and are entitled to participate ; &quot;
&quot; remember that according to the statement of the same paragraph , the parties which are able to do so are to contribute to further development of the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , especially in the territory of non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party ; &quot;
&quot; in DER , Article III paragraph 4 stipul@@ ates that non @-@ state @-@ armed states , the contracting party , are either individually or jointly with other states according to the statutes of the Articles of Stat@@ ute , to comply with the requirements of this article ; &quot;

&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the follow @-@ up procedure on the phases of the fuel circuit that may be produced , processing , use and storage of core material , from which no further nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons could be produced , and that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) For the effective implementation of the securing measures according to this Convention , the Community of the Organization appro@@ ves information on core material that is subject to safegu@@ ards , and on the characteristics of the facilities necessary to carry out the securing measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organisation requires only the minimum of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention .
&quot; ( II ) Information on plants shall be limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the application of securing measures relating to nuclear material that is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) In search of the community , the organisation is ready to examine investment data which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not require the organization to be materi@@ ally obsol@@ ete , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and the States for the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) elev@@ ates the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a specific designation , so the organisation of the community and the states suggests one or more alternative extensions . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the repeated refusal of the community to agree to the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization which are hin@@ dered by this convention , the Council will discuss the refusal by the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the Director General , &quot; with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can , in fact , fulfill their duties according to their Convention . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are established in such a way that the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) ensure the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge of related confidential information .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks following this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this agreement are concluded with regard to core material , if the community and the organization find that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or virtually non @-@ recycl@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the community noti@@ fies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention , the transfer of nuclear material from the states subject to the securing measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement are concluded with regard to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this agreement , has taken over the responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation conduc@@ ts documents from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so that the association with the organization shall be terminated by such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated following this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material may not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community shall ensure that the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will be determined how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is kept on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural conventions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a non @-@ confidentiality understanding of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the association , the states or persons subject to their sovereign authority , however , inc@@ ur extraordinary costs as a result of a special enquiry of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se those costs , provided they have agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which is required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the community or a state against the organization or organization against the organization or organization against the community or a state due to damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - is asser@@ ted in accordance with international law .
&quot; after checking the relevant material submitted by the General Director , the Council notes that the organisation has not been able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to securing measures , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear weapons , can be reimbur@@ sed to the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and if necessary also take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied safety measures , offers the community or the state - as far as each of the parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore , that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any disputes , any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , and shall not be included in the negotiation process or by another of the organisation , the community and the states , to submit to an arbitr@@ ator composed of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also nam@@ ing two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named as arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the states or organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbitr@@ ator , the community or organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure shall be applied if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal &apos;s members are competent , and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding upon the organisation , the community and the concerned States . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; 2 ) If the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this State , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the parties concerned about a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all member states of the organization immediately of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the states receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the States &apos;s contracting party is the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ ards established in this Agreement is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such bi@@ fur@@ cation by the risk of early detection .
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , associated with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , the quantity of material , which is not specified for a specified period of time , speci@@ fies the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out its investigations , the organization makes for article 3 full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the core material community based on this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its securing measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures of the following type will be used and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of un@@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
) provisions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reporting reports to the organization in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) If the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit described under the letter c ) is not yet reached in the States , the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is produced according to composition and purity for the production of fuel or the is@@ ot@@ op@@ ane accumulation , is the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is not liable or desirable from resi@@ dues , so the organisation and the community should consult each other about the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
&quot; a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; ( B ) core material if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures after this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total material quantity liberated from this Article in the States is at no time more than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , or below ; &quot;
&quot; if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures according to this agreement , provisions for re @-@ use of the securing measures are made on that material . &quot;
&quot; the association meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which in the scope necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in particular determine how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements may be extended or amended without alter@@ ing this convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states make every effort to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the consent between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization presents a summ@@ arized inventory of the core material underlying in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory as a result of subsequent reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special reaction program specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource management problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States within six months after the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the E@@ EC organisation has presented a table which is intended to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; Special Ac@@ counting account &quot; , &quot; which is made up of the funds which the Member States shall contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is used by the organization as administrator of the trade and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; ) only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is led separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the concerned state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines stipul@@ ated for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may pay the payments before the above dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional conc@@ ession to the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately . &quot;
&quot; when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions : &quot;
the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent loan capacity to loan terms without a discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; every special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices applied for the funds financed by the organization . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the Special Action Account may not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s Bank or the Organisation for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transactions loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; thus , in ten free years , they are paid back in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
&quot; every special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and who may be the recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
&quot; until the full awar@@ ding of all the special transactions loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC about the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of re@@ payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator under@@ goes the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transactions loans and the expenses made there@@ for . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the E@@ EC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which from the accounts recei@@ vable to the account are paid and the deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full output of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time include an exchange of ideas on the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special actions and on all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this Agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount of all special transactions carried out by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the member states of the Member States agree to the Council of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General will carry out these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement will take effect on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned Noti@@ fications in the Organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally authentic . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement in the form of a correspondence to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 is to be concluded between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T is issuing the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ ING : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large trial facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation of a common company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Common Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is very familiar with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work is carried out , it is in the interest of the contractual parties of the present agreement to sum up their relevant efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research projects , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable each contracting party to get the greatest benefit by pooling their research efforts in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , thus avoiding unnecessary over@@ laps and correspon@@ d@@ ingly the common goal of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to reach the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is so extended or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new programme , this will take place at the place of the program listed in Anne@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 of this Agreement , the parties include an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resources exchange between the Commission and the associated institutions , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Rights . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the common company J@@ ET with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , its stat@@ ute is accepted . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom is also concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose objective is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies charged with the implementation of the association provided in Article 2 section 1 of the present agreement are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement stipul@@ ates in particular the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and to steer clear that the best possible results are achieved in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to guarantee the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions related to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of Eur@@ atom program , is true of all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * determination in the interests of the two parties to the common objective defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly considered . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking this . &quot;
&quot; the groups of advis@@ ors , who submit to the VG research proposals with regard to the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme , take the responsibility for all research and development work to be taken into account in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and who is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , will achieve this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the sessions of all coordin@@ ating committees in the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; coordin@@ ating committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the best possible use of resources , staff and knowledge and skills required to carry out the Eur@@ atom program , apply this task in the respective field regarding all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research of every Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the preparation of future programs and the determination of its total scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the groups of advis@@ ors and coordin@@ ating committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the shooting of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
&quot; the representatives of the two parties are working on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount that is equal to the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution to the participation of Eur@@ atom is related to the Common Enterprise as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland considers the common company J@@ ET an amount that is determined in accordance with the financial regulations of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Enterprise . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover expenses as part of the Eur@@ atom program for the year is fores@@ een .
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are specified in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland will take all necessary measures to allow Eur@@ atom to be exemp@@ t from customs duties or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions of the portion of items financed by Eur@@ atom , which shall be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , the objects acquired or acquired there may not be utter@@ ed or free of charge in this country , unless otherwise approved by the Federal Council . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
&quot; the B@@ IS could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks have a corresponding application . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for whose application the B@@ IS would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without being exceeded in total five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as with their possible extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods exceeding the Bank &apos;s means , expected to be three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z applied at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z must proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the B@@ IS could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks have a corresponding application . &quot;

&quot; consideration of the reasons : the agreement on the import@@ ation of objects educational , scientific or cultural character - the so @-@ called agreement of Florence - aims to promote free circulation of books , publications and objects educational , scientific or cultural character . &quot;
&quot; on the 19th session of the UNESCO Conference of General Conference on 26 November 1976 , a Protocol to the Treaty of Florence was adopted to grant customs exemp@@ tion for a number of objects that were excluded until this time . this protocol must , even if it is a supplement to the agreement , must be regarded as an agreement separated by this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; subject to the application of the possibilities offered by number 16 letter a ) , the provisions of the Protocol agree with the objectives of the European Economic Community . &quot;

&quot; the conclusion of the Convention by the Community brings - without prejudi@@ ce to the legal acts , which it later releases - no expansion of the exclusive responsibilities of the community . &quot;
&quot; due to the particular situation of Greenland with regard to the natural conditions of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be exemp@@ ted from the scope of the convention - &quot;
the Convention to preserve the migr@@ ating wild animal species is approved in the name of the European Economic Community .

&quot; in particular care for those species of wild animals , which migr@@ ate across the national jurisdiction borders or outside the same company ; &quot;
&quot; in the realization that states are the prot@@ ectors of the migr@@ ating animal species and must be , who live or cross in their national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; in the conviction that conservation and effective heat and use of migr@@ ating animal species require common actions of all states , in whose national competences these types spend part of their life cycle ; &quot;

&quot; 3 . both at present and in the fores@@ eeable future , sufficient habitat is present to preserve the population of the migr@@ ating species in the long term &quot;
&quot; 4 . the spread and population @-@ size of the wandering type approxim@@ ates the historical conditions according to expansion and circum@@ ference in a mass in which potentially suitable ecos@@ ystems are present , and this is compatible with meaningful le@@ vers and use ; &quot;
&quot; D ) the &quot; &quot; maintenance situation &quot; &quot; is considered &quot; &quot; un@@ favorable &quot; &quot; if any of the conditions specified in the preceding paragraph is not authorised ; &quot;

&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and the request for trade negotiations at its meeting of 11 April and 12 April 1979 , expressed wish to arrive at a uniform version of an agreement on the implementation of Article VII of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement ; &quot;
considering that Article 27 of the Convention concerning Change has not yet entered into force - I
1 . agree to cancel the provision of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
2 . recognise that the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the application of this convention by five years in accordance with Article 21 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 in practice for some developing countries may be insufficient .
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period prior to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the period mentioned in Article 21 ( 1 ) , whereby the contracting parties must examine such an application in cases where the development country can offer good reasons , ben@@ evol@@ ent ; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the use of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat from the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled bull - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina have been set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure through appropriate procedures that the amount actually executed does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form be made possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argent@@ ine@@ an access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community is obliged to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ at rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount specified under number 2 , corresponding to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be established in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the rate of value stated under number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount given under number 2 will be determined by the day of the Greek accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaughter . &quot;
the community under@@ takes all to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation does not under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other subsi@@ dy measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering determined living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina warran@@ ts compliance with this agreement , in particular by providing a set of export lic@@ ences set out in this agreement for the products specified under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the Community is obliged to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products , originating in Argentina , is made dependent on the draft of an export licence , which is given by the responsible authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that a deposit may be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods .
&quot; in addition , in implementing regulations , the responsible Argent@@ ine authority of the competent authority of the Community shall periodic@@ ally determine the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be deco@@ ded according to the country of destination . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement will be properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and the meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance for the goal mentioned under number 7 . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor to refer to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep industry and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal he@@ el of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat is not affected in these markets , I honor the following convention : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled bull - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; new Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat , will ensure access to the Community market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal he@@ el of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation in co @-@ operation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the set amount actually executed does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the quantities stated above are executed in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using this agreement to exploit new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the Community market .
&quot; should a change in the supply form be made possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be established in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the rate of exhaus@@ tion stated in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
the total amount stated in clause 2 will be determined by the day of the Greek accession to the community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of slaughter body weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the normal he@@ el of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties do everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without any risk to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of funds or other subsi@@ dy measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering determined living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be given at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand warran@@ ts compliance with the amounts stated in clause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
&quot; in its turn , the Community is obliged to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products is subject to the source of an export licence , which is granted by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that a deposit may be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods .
&quot; in addition , in implementing regulations , the competent authorities of the competent authority of the Community shall periodic@@ ally determine the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be deco@@ ded according to the country of destination . &quot;
the committee must ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the committee regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and the meat market of the two contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance for the purpose mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the correct use of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat will not be carried out under the agreement named after the Community under the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall not be detri@@ mental to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual quantity stipul@@ ated in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount applicable from the entry into force of this Agreement will be determined in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand , as well as for New Zealand &apos;s main area . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will come into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a deadline of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot;

&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure , through appropriate procedures , to ensure that the actual amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form be made possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;

&quot; in the event that the imports from Uruguay are exceeding the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ at rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;

C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted through blood trans@@ fu@@ sions as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle by a closed , sterile tube system in which the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was fu@@ eled before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood flow , the bottle is immediately to be closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , it must first be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined in the hands of the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;

&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells components may be present or may have been removed partially .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentr@@ ates consists either of the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ it ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the filling must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so on the label , its volume and composition must be stated . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through drying out of the liquid , which sett@@ les down at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ gation or sedi@@ mentation of human solid blood . &quot;
human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water that corresponds to the amount of liquid , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the so @-@ called solution must not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not show any visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all blood samples tested which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the titanium is measured twice in a suitable medium by constantly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cell in@@ filtration in the total volume .
&quot; anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at present standards . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ filtration .
the Tit@@ er indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which International standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as a complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed based on the re @-@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;

the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in a fluctu@@ ant form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they are dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent State authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the pre@@ conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ vial or re @-@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;

&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the amount contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; adequate samples of all the re@@ agents are stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and preserve the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective share . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; a &quot; &quot; un@@ dil@@ uted &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison with C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum is to react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more individuals who are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ inous C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floods of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; this is why these Ser@@ a are only specific to the C an@@ tigen , if the blood cells tested are wound up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ ans of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and should not contain any form of Anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer must be effective at the same time . &quot;
&quot; if a serum is used for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the anti @-@ inflammatory antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ amine no human red blood cells containing no A an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ amine no human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison , with a flush of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % absorption of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the dual time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; the assumption that it is appropriate to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a unified management document , &quot;
&quot; in DER A@@ mend@@ ment , that this Agreement may not be interpreted in a way that it exclu@@ des the contracting parties from its obligations under other international treaties - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to facilitate the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a consistency paper ) is introduced , which is to be used in particular a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ances related to the trade between the contracting parties are authorized by means of a single api@@ ary , for which the prints are to be used in Anne@@ x I to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the uniform paper serves as an application or paper for export , dispatch or import . &quot;
&quot; - in order to carry out legal regulations in force in a contracting party , the application of which would not be guaranteed in case of any use of the uni@@ formity ; &quot;
&quot; - to be asked by the parties , so that they may be able to return to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement does not hin@@ der the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the participants . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the relevant goods shall not be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete application may be permitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must subsequently be submitted in which it may be submitted with the approval of the competent authorities for a peri@@ odic collection registration , within the deadline specified by the authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be allowed to use instead of a single api@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; if the uniform paper is used , the parties agree with the consent of the competent authorities to provide all the necessary form@@ alities associated with the export and import@@ ation , instead of the supplementary sheets attached to the trade paper in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;

&quot; to allow the competent authorities in case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of applications , that the export , shipping or import registration shall be made either by the single entry paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
&quot; - to apply relief , which was adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a decision according to Article 11 ( 3 ) paragraph 3 . &quot;

&quot; if applicable , the customs authority of the country of destination or its representative may require a translation of the registration in the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In accordance with paragraph 1 , the registration shall always be made in one of the official languages of the import country , if they are submitted in this country using other copies of the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or its representative can use for each individual process section of a distribution agreement between the contracting parties , which may only be included in this one section of the registration examples , to which if necessary , necessary copies can be added to the transfer of the cases in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be associated with a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collection shipments , the relevant authorities can fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for the export and the dispatch process have to be brought to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies intended for these cases . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of article 7 , the relevant authorities are convincing as far as possible that the information contained in the copies executed in the individual process sections shall be consistent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth distribution of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries ask one another , or - if they regard it from interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or denied in whole or in part , if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or would violate any operating , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;

&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which it would not afford , if it were to be sought , it points out to this circum@@ stance in its request . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and shall enjoy the protection that the national law of the country which it has received , shall be granted for the purposes of this kind . &quot;
&quot; this information may only be used with the written consent of the customs authority , which it has issued , and may otherwise be used otherwise by the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;

&quot; to facilitate understanding , comparing and evaluating statistical data , especially those of international trade , in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce the costs resulting from the fact that goods have to be re @-@ defined and re @-@ enco@@ ded in the international trade traffic , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of trade documents and the transmission of data , &quot;
&quot; in DER , the development of technology and the structures of international trade made significant changes to the Brussels Treaty of 15 December 1950 about the tari@@ ff scheme for the import of commodities into the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE W@@ ise that the level of differentiation demanded by the governments and the economy for customs tari@@ ffs and statistical purposes is far beyond that which is contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in DER , it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations ; &quot;
&quot; in DER , the Harmon@@ ised System is to be used for the freight rates and traffic statistics of the various types of transport , &quot;
&quot; in DER , the Harmon@@ ised System is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in the trade to name and code the goods , &quot;
&quot; in DER A@@ mend@@ ment that the harmon@@ ised system should contribute to achieving a close relationship between import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other , IN DER the assumption that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ized system and the International War@@ ehouse of the United Nations should be maintained . &quot;
&quot; in DER , it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff of tari@@ ffs and statistics , which is suitable for use by the international trade involved . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that it is important to ensure adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for the cooperation in the field of customs duties , the Committee has made a contribution to the harmon@@ ised system in this field . &quot;
&quot; in THE weighing , that - although the aforementioned agreement has proven to be an effective instrument in order to achieve some of these goals - the conclusion of a new international convention is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this convention , a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system &quot; signi@@ fies the designation and codi@@ fication of the commodities , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ized system , &quot; consisting of positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to the sections . chapters and sub @-@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ized system ; &quot;

amend@@ ment Protocol to the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of goods ( events on Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
&quot; the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Co @-@ operation in the Area of Custom@@ s Service , &quot;
&quot; on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods came into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in DER A@@ mend@@ ment , that without a change of article 13 of the aforementioned convention , the date of the entry into force of this Convention would remain uncertain - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , paragraph 1 is issued as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on January 1 , following the exp@@ iry of at least three months immediately following the date , at which at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or business uni@@ on@@ ens signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or have deposited their rati@@ fication or accession documents , but not before January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; a . this Protocol takes into force concur@@ r@@ ently with the Convention , provided that at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or business uni@@ on@@ ens signed in Article 11 of the Convention have deposited their certificates on the adoption of the Protocol at the Council &apos;s General Sec@@ retariat for co @-@ operation in the field of customs . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or customs or business uni@@ on@@ ens can post@@ p@@ one the certificate of acceptance of this Protocol , which had previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time sign or disclose their certificate of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B . every state and every customs or economic union , the contracting party of the convention after the entry into force of this Protocol to par , is the contracting party of the convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; it is a plant that is indispensable not only for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but also allows for the exploitation of land , which makes no other planting possible , and even with extensive cultivation , which is the main part of today &apos;s production , responds to any improvement in cultivation methods . &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS D@@ AR@@ AU@@ F , that the existence and standard of living of millions of families depend upon its cultivation , which are completely dependent on the measures that are made for the maintenance and expansion of the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;

protocol to the 1979 Convention on Gra@@ y @-@ Ter@@ m Shi@@ py@@ ards of Air pollution in relation to the elimination of emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their green @-@ bil@@ lowing river
&quot; concerned that the current emissions of air @-@ contaminated substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural value of vital importance for the environment and the economy , &quot;
&quot; remember that the Ex@@ ek@@ uti@@ lit@@ arian has recognised the need for the Convention on its second meeting to effectively reduce the annual total emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from stationary and mobile sources , or their green @-@ reaching flow to 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , retain their emissions limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their follow @-@ up products to the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their green @-@ growing river , in particular by applying suitable national emission limits for new mobile larger site @-@ solid sources as well as by retro@@ fitting existing larger local sources , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that the scientific and technical knowledge of these questions continue to develop , and that this development is to be taken into account when examining the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; recognizing that the el@@ aboration of a solution based on critical stress has the aim of creating an effective scientific basis to take into account the implementation of this protocol and decision on further international agreed measures , &quot;
&quot; recognizing that the rapid testing of procedures to create more favourable conditions for a technology exchange contributes to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the Commission &apos;s region , &quot;
