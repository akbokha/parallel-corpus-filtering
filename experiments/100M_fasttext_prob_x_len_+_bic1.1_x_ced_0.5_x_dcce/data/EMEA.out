&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B . wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are also broken down as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its re@@ occurring . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re @-@ occurrence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent re@@ occurring , to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic fluid ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients on the basis of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment was examined . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for inclusion .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies to man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy was also effective for up to 74 weeks as a placebo to treat man@@ ic episodes of previously untreated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inclusion ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( leak@@ age ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with mostly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , when oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and related to their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors can justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over @-@ line disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ign form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials involving a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dos@@ ages , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height before the accompanying therapy begins . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be counted with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in animal reproductive studies in the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of decreased incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ic , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared with patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was observed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was observed in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ ti@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was observed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % was observed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute sur@@ geri@@ es with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma retention . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D and D@@ 3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ name . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of respon@@ der patients who contributed to the study meditation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sen @-@ depression scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher return rate showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ti@@ in controlled , multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a recovery effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share in patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo superior to the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ loc@@ ating of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , cataly@@ zes N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ var@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ments accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the 3 to 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate concentrations found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the study were no longer than 6 % of the concentrations found in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro resolution . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for single doses of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo superior to the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo superior to the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ke@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo superior to the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , can use the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; a m@@ n &apos;s clinical manifestations are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ti@@ in controlled , multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) in a relative bio@@ availability study .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used for quick control of as@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the circum@@ ference of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with a@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over @-@ line disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ign form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , alternating consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ gregation was greater compared to the intra@@ muscular use of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) in a study where healthy volunteers were administered intra@@ muscular and the same time lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) was intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 results in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height before the accompanying therapy begins . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were obtained intra@@ muscular , the intensity of se@@ gregation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was observed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % was observed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the long @-@ term study period , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement of as@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as as@@ tig@@ mati@@ sm and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of as@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am Reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ dity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of respon@@ der patients who contributed to the study meditation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depres@@ sions scale , showed significantly greater improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher decline in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - ( oral ) group , and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ ti@@ in controlled , multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l resulted in superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo superior to the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % higher the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time was applied to the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the application of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns resulted in mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ments accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time until the worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel alone . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
&quot; the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel , and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to authori@@ ze the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane to the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ osp@@ els &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series . &quot;
&quot; in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which may have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately set off and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ es rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly defined multip@@ licity of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac in@@ cases in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients have nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ the@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child to bear . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility exists because of the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and major incidents of side effects which occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated at the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy during each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , flat@@ ul@@ ence , burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest , weakness of muscles , neck pain , pain in the skel@@ etal muscles , back pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ timi@@ zing micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules that promote the con@@ formation of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ ze the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ compos@@ ing poly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ vers@@ al end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ blind@@ ed trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks either as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had no chemotherapy previously , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced an peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure of active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
&quot; in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative leak@@ age was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and similar to other potentially toxic substances should be considered when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle . &quot;
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good use of the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then the pier@@ cing bottle should be slowly and gently swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete reset @-@ board of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itations or sm@@ el@@ ines are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle has to be revers@@ ed gently in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension prior to the application . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and inj@@ ected the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane into an empty , sterile PVC or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
&quot; the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing the drug must make sure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 and presented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the approval application , is set up and works before and while the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane must not be applied : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other ingredients of Abra@@ x@@ ane • if you are breast@@ feeding • if your white blood cells are degra@@ ded ( starting values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ osp@@ els of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about it )
&quot; special caution when applying Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have a impaired ren@@ al function • If you suffer from feeling num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from severe liver problems • if you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; if you use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine , as these may possibly cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised in advance of the treatment of a sperm conservation , as the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility exists through the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment . &quot;
&quot; abrasion and the use of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machines . &quot;
&quot; if you receive other medicines as part of your treatment , you should consult with regard to driving or operating machines from your doctor . &quot;

&quot; the rare side effects ( at least 1 of 10,000 patients reported ) are : • lung infection • skin reaction to another substance after radiation • blood cl@@ ots &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; if it is not immediately used , it can be stored in the water bottle up to 8 hours in the fridge ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) when it is stored in the box to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; each diar@@ rhe@@ a contains 100 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After the constitution , every ml of the suspension contains 5 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ escence from humans ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and application of Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances should be considered when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
&quot; slowly and gently pi@@ v@@ ot and / or in@@ vert the pier@@ cing bottle for at least 2 minutes , until a complete reset @-@ board of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and inj@@ ected the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane into an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;
par@@ enter@@ al medicines should be subjected to potential particles and disc@@ ol@@ or@@ ations prior to the application of a visual inspection whenever the solution or containers allow this .
&quot; stable un@@ opened hat@@ ch@@ back bottles with Abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date indicated on the packaging , when the pier@@ cing bottle is stored in the cardboard box to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; stability of the re@@ constituted suspension in the pier@@ cing bottle After the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should immediately be filled into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the market launch will provide healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochures • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packing supplement . • A clear picture of the correct use of the product , provided cool@@ ers for transport by the patient . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ ys@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medi@@ cam@@ ents &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if bleeding is not possible before the intervention , and in which a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ab@@ ys@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ ys@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ vers if they have received appropriate instructions .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter for adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or because the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference resin . &quot;
&quot; all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein , before they were either converted to se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ et@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mi@@ gra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; par@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the European Union regulations , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces stre@@ et@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the distribution of ab@@ ys@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction in trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ ys@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and consequences can vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a suitable dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose should be reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia . &quot;
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a suitable dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of prec@@ urs@@ ors increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l versus the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the label number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te numbers increased by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / µ@@ l versus the initial value , is an indication of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy impro@@ b@@ able and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required should receive par@@ se@@ amed twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure .
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the se@@ amed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug into circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ) should not receive any ab@@ ys@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esia known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following advantages , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ o@@ xi@@ co@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te Index ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration needed to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients under chemotherapy should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to reduce the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ otherap@@ y@@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the participation of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in case of treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial stem cell value of &gt; 13 g / dl , there may be an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer received chemotherapy when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ctic , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , neur@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , ret@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and , in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to the endo@@ genous human@@ oid ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ fi@@ cal patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 mam@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 22 prostate cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis . &quot;
survival and progression of tumour were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these trials were double blind placebo controlled trials
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ solved , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ in@@ fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be traced back to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ in@@ etry compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximately the 20@@ s of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has resulted in reduced f@@ ec@@ al body weight , a delay in the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of an out@@ patient application , the patient can store par@@ se@@ amed once for a period of 3 days outside the cooling case and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ating rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued label , so that if necessary , measurement of partial amounts is possible . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ ys@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .

&quot; the holder of the authorisation for placing the drug has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system listed in Version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is applied in the transport . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation for marketing authorisation is committed to the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as each subsequent risk management plan adopted by CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in receiving new information that could have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) &quot;
&quot; • In a month before your treatment , have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( occurring or increased chest pain ) • if you have already performed such a blood c@@ lot in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the throat vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
during treatment with se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets which are re@@ formed during further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before the start of therapy with se@@ amed . &quot;
very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin of spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will break down your therapy with ab@@ ys@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore par@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and death risk could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of bleeding with ab@@ ys@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of ab@@ ys@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your gra@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , bear in mind that par@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you are facing a major orthop@@ a@@ edic operation , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before treatment starts , and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive par@@ se@@ amed since there is an increased risk of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines , or have been recently taken / applied , even if they are non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ ys@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory investigations showed no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood type ( an@@ emia ) addresses the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will arrange regular blood tests if necessary , in order to verify the treatment success and to ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ ys@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;

&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones rup@@ ittle ) , both in women after menop@@ ause and in men . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like hyst@@ er@@ esis ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or receive injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the disease , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8,000 older women were involved in o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies by a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the distribution of A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a C@@ ret@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents in A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as there are limited clinical experiences for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of severe side effects reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial , &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , unwanted drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated with a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were compared to three years in a clinical study in o@@ steopor@@ osis between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently supp@@ ressed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was reported , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ori@@ onic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the jaw area at one with A@@ cla@@ sta and in a patient treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fluid .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid @-@ body frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures at a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip around 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic crest .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) and the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; overall mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on overall fragran@@ ces and 4.3 % on the scar@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly mild to moderate pac@@ ed disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proven in two @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ders at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was observed in 141 patients with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes per@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma cutting rose quickly to &lt; 10 % of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early phases ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clearing amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine clearing , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid required .
there are no statements in this population for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian IV single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ times of recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , the ren@@ al tolerance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in rats was determined ; in dogs a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg was administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; the most common occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the preparation time and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for approval of the Pharmaceu@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ co @-@ Management @-@ Plan The holder of approval for the marketing authorisation is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance approved in the Pharma Co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the adopted version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the approval application and all following versions of the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a compound of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; a@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone structure again , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / use other medicines / have recently been taken / applied , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cla@@ sta , together with food and drink , you can be sure that you take plenty of fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions and take care of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to admini@@ ster A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please consult your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; at present it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms with you after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or craw@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or notice any side effects not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions right up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are advised to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid on the bone structure , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ ema may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia is used with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or above and / or above , one or several &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting smoking . &quot;
&quot; however , the studies on setting smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what is the risk associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and upper respiratory infections . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may ampli@@ fy the risk of depression and , among other things , may cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable in simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ itt@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of reducing weight in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; used in patients suffering from health and not cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the AR@@ Z &quot;
it Ad@@ ditional to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) that have one or more risk factors n@@ g such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because of the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who , besides obesity , have no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;

• El@@ derly patient The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances . &quot;
the effect of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone can &apos;t be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar values were reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of an additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fa resin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied at 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ cris@@ y ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - ac@@ id@@ ac@@ al levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to distribute Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , there was an increase in reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated levels of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values can be controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms which point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one continues should be guided until the clinical assessment of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven to be able to stir up fat deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , the therapy with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one showed a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes have been observed in comparing controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin , or as a dual combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report about disturbances in visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ c . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one AU@@ C by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one &apos;s AU@@ C by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity of the mother animal is reduced and the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates is reduced for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the index and index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across three times the upper limit of the normal range were equally common compared to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa drugs . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
&quot; since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency has rarely been reported under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , but more frequently , if pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were conducted in the groups treated with comparison media . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures increased at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show symptoms . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ amine production in the liver and increases the peri@@ ph@@ ere glu@@ cos@@ amine in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the output values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks investigation of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduced total plastic matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one whereas values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial raised tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in plasma are generally achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the pig@@ let ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers .
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and apes were consistent with plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity of the mother animal is reduced and the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates is reduced for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
&quot; in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ ones led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tumours . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ c . &quot;
in another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the output values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summ@@ ari@@ al analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , and over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication showed a higher incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial raised tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly , for example by an intensive insulin therapy , can detect the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which goes through several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must take into account possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other medicines taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Peri@@ pher@@ al Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally rever@@ sible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the abdominal tissue joint Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection point can arise a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur . &quot;
&quot; immune system disorders - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disturbances , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , be gradually developed : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have glucose , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or through glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane water bottle has been removed from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not more than 25 ° C ) before it is stressed in accordance with the operating instructions for the first use .
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must take into account possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other medicines taken by them . &quot;

proceed as follows to avoid the inj@@ ections of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • knock a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
&quot; while air bubbles are present , they will accumulate in the cartridge - While you continue to keep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let continue with the injection needle , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( Figure D ) • While you continue to keep the injection needle up , press the button inside ( Figure D ) • Now must leak from the tip of the injection needle a drop of insulin . &quot;
&quot; • Set the cap back to the finished pen , that the digit 0 stands opposite the metering stamp ( figure E ) • Check if the button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if not , turn the connector cap until the push button is pressed completely • Ke@@ ep your Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Clip horizont@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; when the push button is not able to move freely outside , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the connector shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outward , while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the closing cap right next to the dosing stamp • Add the highest number you can see on the push button • add the two numbers to get the inserted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise insulin is extracted from the injection needle and the recommended dose will not be correct . if you &apos;ve mistakenly attempted to set up a dose of more than 78 units , follow the steps below : &quot;
then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 is opposite the metering brand .
&quot; make sure to press the push button only during the injection . • Ke@@ ep the push button immediately after the injection , until the needle is pulled out of the skin . &quot;
&quot; if not , turn the connector cap until the push button is pressed completely and then proceed as described before using • Can you hear a cli@@ ck@@ ling noise when pressing the button . &quot;
it may be uncomfortable • You can &apos;t set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantities scale to estimate how much insulin remains .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the distribution of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast acting insulin must be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic notes ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; , &quot; i.e. bigger ur@@ anium deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first months of treatment , there may still be rheum@@ atic attacks ; for this reason , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic treatment should be treated at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic drugs . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , taking part in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic do@@ si@@ ations ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( pseudo medication ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
in both studies allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood at the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily intake 120 mg , in the last three measurements have a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , nausea , skin rash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently available rheum@@ atism and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum har@@ dening process still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other res@@ inous drugs , it may occur during the treatment beginning to acute g@@ out attack , because the lowering of the serum resin table may initially mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases occurs so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function before beginning of the fa@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ute and in the further course ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was not carried out interaction studies at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ ophy@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , is dela@@ ying the intake of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and causes a decline in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be concluded on side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of adverse events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ographic group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistical significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be determined . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ an@@ esth@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin irrit@@ ation , skin les@@ ion , bur@@ si@@ tis , kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , the effect mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ ine metabolism and arises as part of the Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin Re@@ action sk@@ ade → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro in@@ hibition that lies beneath the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ b@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ monthly diabe@@ tic acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value to study time of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose al@@ loc@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the serum level of serum on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of the serum har@@ n@@ lic acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ lic concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent decrease in the serum har@@ dening gap was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a de@@ formation ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a de@@ formation ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the top marks up to 24 months . &quot;
T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and were also received in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; following the intake of simple or multiple oral dos@@ ages of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage drop in serum har@@ n@@ lic acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cutting of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent across the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ eful cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average overall AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver Rest@@ ri@@ ction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- P@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , with approximately the 11 @-@ fold exposure of humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant to clinical application .
it has been found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a develop@@ mental retard@@ ation in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in bearing rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ ophy@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ monthly diabe@@ tic acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent decrease in the serum har@@ dening gap was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a de@@ formation ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a de@@ formation ) . &quot;

&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;

&quot; the holder of the authorisation for placing the drug has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application , is ready before the medicine is brought into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) in accordance with CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • If new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk im@@ itation • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the substance F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or one of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
&quot; tell your doctor before you start taking this medication , if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated with a high ur@@ ic acid concentration as a result of cancer or les@@ ch @-@ ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , hyper@@ sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cl@@ ung before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplement ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who only took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also submitted data to indicate that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive organs such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , driven abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other component . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplement ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms , which indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in case of symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe ocular side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine properly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and can be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , rarely ( after market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men contains predominantly intraven@@ ously given bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there is no available data to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when consuming a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated prior to the onset of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can interfere with the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate damaging effects directly related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but it was also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the Ser@@ um Cal@@ ci@@ ums increased to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ struction of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , est@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ol to vitamin D@@ 3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

after 15 weeks of treatment the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 56 n@@ g / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate The therapeutic equ@@ ation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the medium ascent of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years was 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % in fem@@ ur h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the trol@@ ley . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved with the share of patients suffering one or more spinal frac@@ tures . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the path@@ ways of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption Be@@ ading on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before accepting a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability increased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distri@@ butions of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous offering of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ec@@ es . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In case of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics of patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the share of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients , to whom a kidney or liver was transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , and the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and studied , as Adv@@ agra@@ ph is included in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ ance may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ance , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ised yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ dition of the formulation or regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
Adv@@ agra@@ ph dosage should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see recommendations below )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels should be controlled before change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ance dose can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral consumption of pharmaceuticals , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be intraven@@ ously initiated ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dose Rec@@ ommen@@ dations - St@@ ren@@ al transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may later be necessary because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dose Rec@@ ommen@@ dations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph A must be converted from two daily dos@@ ages of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one time daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose . &quot;
&quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; cardiac transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recipients , although there is no clinical experience with advance , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , resulted in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol , a calculation of the cre@@ atine @-@ lear@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels .
&quot; it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ents during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; also after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a drug with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in full blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ dition of the formulation or regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ised formulation advance . &quot;
&quot; proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ised formulation advance . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical impact of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , sp@@ as@@ ms and visual disturbances should show , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , lac@@ tose are included in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 hem@@ mer ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and , in order to increase hormone exposure , precau@@ tions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va often cannot be determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
&quot; below , the side effects after their incidence are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sion therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors related to treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ zable . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell membrane .
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cles genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed cases of evacu@@ ation occurred within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % , and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed in advance . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplan@@ tation The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ ance and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mos@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 97@@ ,5 % for pro@@ gra@@ f ; 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Adv@@ agra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ ph C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) died of death . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of two daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules according to other primary organ transplan@@ ts , Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 treatment transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and were used in 6@@ 30 cases after bow@@ el transplan@@ tation as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent , multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported which received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0,@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients surrounded by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in one study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients who were simultaneously receiving a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t based on a random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the targeted level of the descent from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) at 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ zumab , leading to valley mirrors between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ine and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the non @-@ bound Group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ance was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
&quot; it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ents during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advance is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug @-@ approved drug called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate in the European Union , but it is manufactured in a different way so that the drug contains no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , adv@@ ates in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ als were awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of lawyers ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to transport lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency and the place and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the specified plasma gas ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differentiate in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be directed after the patient has been received , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia known inhibit@@ ors , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product was observed on another inhibit@@ or re@@ occurring . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s reported in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , who had a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients a few repeated product ex@@ positions were reported in the study on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes . &quot;

all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs was in the area of the abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions posed to him , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based upon examining the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ enti@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people coming in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite , that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; in adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunt ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; a@@ ero may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from an angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary drainage ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cutting , breaking or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within the 2 weeks after the end of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , erg@@ ot@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ olin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ az@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment of hyper@@ tension or p@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or p@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical ex@@ ams with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , irrespective of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not block in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies showed no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary from a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , sc@@ ary mi@@ ction , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ kor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity , and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hä@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ Selec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; for a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including reinfor@@ cing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ athetic effects , such as raising blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio @-@ equivalent was for exposure after offering an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic for the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application described in the Pharmaceu@@ tical App@@ lic@@ ant System , and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance that can un@@ fold its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of the s@@ wollen drug , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer which leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck seal , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the patient &apos;s history ( breathing difficulties due to a cra@@ mp@@ ing of pul@@ mon@@ ary muscles ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or conditions under the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze application : • hyper@@ tension • Heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache , or strengthening of head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; when applied in recommended dosage , it is not expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduces attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you forgot the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; heart hunt , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hun@@ ts , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach problems , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , nausea , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal or allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by investigating the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ elling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the approval of the symptom spectrum was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ erial may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous illness and can be terminated after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
&quot; in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for continuous treatment during the allergy . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches . this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hä@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including reinfor@@ cing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms , irrespective of ae@@ ti@@ ology , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine irrit@@ ation is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ erial was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the dis@@ ruption of sleep and vi@@ gil@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not depend on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed , in a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; colorful film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ gly@@ col , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ eric , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed and experienced higher exposure levels ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup &apos;s safety in children aged between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normal .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ erial tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup @-@ group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dosage ) .
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily carbohydr@@ ate intake of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dosage ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ erial tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not harm the psych@@ om@@ otor system . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither resulted in increasing alcohol @-@ induced loss of power nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ erial tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ erial was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup@@ ting of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are partially met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ zed bottles with child @-@ proof poly@@ propylene inter@@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ erial tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ erial tablets were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including reinfor@@ cing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ erial tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials to be effective in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Si@@ rup@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the inclusion formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

&quot; for a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including reinfor@@ cing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet with A@@ erial 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; as@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of the prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablet found that this formulation is an unlikely risk of local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who metabol@@ ise normal . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group .
&quot; infants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than in placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for the intake of no adverse events was observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
&quot; in addition to established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms , and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

&quot; since A@@ erial Solution includes the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no Bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ igned from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu , caused by the strain of H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus . &quot;
this is a special kind of vaccine intended to protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread by humans to humans , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly when contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a body @-@ alien ) , was puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for treating adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , ap@@ est@@ asis is available as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drug of the patient previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ cur@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cur@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ inflammatory drug A@@ cur@@ ase increased with low dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who used to be prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia previously , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ cur@@ ase , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml as placebo , but ap@@ eri@@ asis was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cur@@ ase also decreased the viral load in children , but only very few of the children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the anti @-@ inflammatory drug A@@ cur@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it occurred under A@@ gen@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks as with the patients receiving their former prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of ap@@ est@@ asis ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ cur@@ ase must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ cur@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are broken down in the same way as A@@ cur@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of a lip@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ cur@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared the risks .
&quot; ap@@ est@@ asis is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of ap@@ est@@ asis in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cur@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the distribution of ap@@ ex in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years old . &quot;
usually A@@ cur@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ cur@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ap@@ est@@ asis in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ est@@ asis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ cur@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width , and can also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that ap@@ eri@@ asis or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ est@@ asis does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ cur@@ ase capsules should be used together with low dos@@ ages of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver problems with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre@@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of ap@@ eri@@ asis and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , which are mixed over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabol@@ isation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous dosing of A@@ cur@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ubar@@ b poly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ cur@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ at@@ ent@@ ular symptoms , especially if there are still low dos@@ ages of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl glass content of the A@@ cur@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cur@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ id@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapies were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors associated with prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis are present . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long@@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width ap@@ eri@@ asis cannot be given at the same time with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width , and can also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width ap@@ eri@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active substances are predominantly used via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for increased plasma levels .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compensate for the reduced plasma gas levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ ors are available and , if possible , check the viral load and reset the St. John &apos;s Wort . &quot;
dosage adju@@ v@@ ant for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; 52 % degra@@ ded , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for concur@@ rent administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ an component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ cur@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is recommended because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cutting . &quot;
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ eri@@ asis , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or In@@ duc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may possibly result in interactions between them . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with ap@@ eri@@ asis .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ cur@@ ase , since it can lead to erectile dysfunction . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
&quot; simultaneous intake with ap@@ eri@@ asis can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had been given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of A@@ cur@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in plasma cutting are expected at the same time . &quot;
&quot; because plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous dispens@@ ation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ cur@@ ase must not be applied together with an or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of as@@ par@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
data on simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma cutting of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ at@@ ent@@ ative symptoms , especially if there are still low dos@@ ages of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ agents along with A@@ cur@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or reinfor@@ cing the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ able , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous dispens@@ ation of ap@@ ri@@ asis ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven ; however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to human breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us to the end of the down@@ time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase in 12 body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
&quot; further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
A@@ cur@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the ap@@ eri@@ asis treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the termination of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of ap@@ est@@ asis or another at the same time used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1,@@ 200 mg ap@@ est@@ asis twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as during the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ po@@ yst@@ rop@@ hies ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ AB 300@@ 6 trial , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s were treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin rash were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of ap@@ eri@@ asis twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , type and frequency of side effects ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed in patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ sth@@ eses with the result of an un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 46@@ I / M / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ol @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ol @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ ine @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ ol@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ ol@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ol @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early departure of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ cur@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , with PI pre @-@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice a day ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ ap@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inferior quality of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ ad@@ read@@ ed average variation of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ lower threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution was used for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
there was no low dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with ap@@ eri@@ asis .
&quot; after 48 weeks about 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; ap@@ eri@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generic Solution and A@@ generic Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be reduced to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regi@@ mens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without concur@@ rent administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were found in dos@@ ages which accounted for 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; out of the present exposure data on humans , both in clinical studies and in the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation@@ test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of ap@@ est@@ asis nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed , which indicate delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ cur@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be done with caution in patients with mild or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentrations . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cur@@ ase should be set in the duration of 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for concur@@ rent administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ia would decrease .
&quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is recommended ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ eri@@ asis , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had been given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ agents along with A@@ cur@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or reinfor@@ cing the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us to the end of the down@@ time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
A@@ cur@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ol @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; ap@@ eri@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be minimal on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were found in doses which accounted for 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; out of the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , there is little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in young , the metabol@@ isation paths are not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;

the benefits of patients treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; G@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ generic Solution should not be used with PI @-@ treated patients or PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ cur@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ cur@@ ase solution for intake and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination should be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although dosage is not considered necessary for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ cur@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
concur@@ rent administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ or of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that ap@@ eri@@ asis or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ cur@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the substance concentrations . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ eri@@ asis should be cancelled in the long run , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis are present . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with ap@@ eri@@ asis can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and result in side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors significantly higher plasma concentrations of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ cur@@ ase solution for intake may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl alcohol contained in the pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven ; however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to human breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us up to the end of the down@@ time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
A@@ cur@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the use of ap@@ est@@ asis or another at the same time used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors were rarely observed . &quot;
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; ap@@ eri@@ asis . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

&quot; - If any of the listed side effects may affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in order to enhance the effect of ap@@ eri@@ asis . &quot;
the use of ap@@ est@@ asis is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you suffer from any of the above mentioned diseases or take any of the drugs mentioned above .
&quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es together with low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure that you read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before starting the treatment . &quot;
&quot; similarly , there is no adequate information to recommend the use of A@@ cur@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fication in children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ cur@@ ase with other medicines , &quot; before you start taking A@@ cur@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control bleeding . − For patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking certain medicines that can lead to serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , li@@ doc@@ ain , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as ap@@ est@@ asis , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems . &quot;
it is recommended that HIV positive women should not satisfy their children under no circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
no studies have been carried out for the influence of ap@@ eri@@ asis on driving skill or the ability to operate machines .
do not use this medicine after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; taking di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine ) , it is advisable that you take this more than an hour before or after A@@ cur@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ap@@ eri@@ asis may be dimin@@ ished . &quot;
dose of A@@ cur@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; if your doctor decides that the intake of k@@ itt@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; it is very important that you take the total daily dose , which your doctor has prescribed for you . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of ap@@ est@@ asis than you should have taken if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ est@@ asis , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
&quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies , in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a full healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream continues to continue until all visible cow@@ ards have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , a different treatment should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cr@@ ème is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with thi@@ ghs infected skin area must be submitted until the cream is fully re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ ening leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous cut@@ aneous medication for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal region , no clinical experience yet exists . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown to be less effective in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after treatment .
&quot; since no data is currently available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered with super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application in pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ dal has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , in the inside of the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the under@@ arms and hands do not support effectiveness in this use case , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions normally take off in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient are causing great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were obtained , neither after a one @-@ time nor after a majority of topical application , there may be no recommendation to apply during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most common adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cow@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ ine od@@ ine ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and most likely , or perhaps with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream associated with side effects , complaints at the application area include an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % . &quot;
the bas@@ al@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; in these studies , the most common adverse event or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cr@@ ème was a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide ) . &quot;
side effects shown by 25@@ 2 in placebo controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; according to the investig@@ ational plan , the clinical evidence assessed in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / leaves / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the study plan , the clinical evidence assessed according to the investig@@ ator shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) came . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ od@@ ine od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently unique oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral dos@@ ages of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy was superior to a complete healing of the bi@@ b war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; with 60 % of patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide , the bi@@ ds completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of patients with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a total healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine during five weeks , over 6 weeks , has been studied in two double blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , has been studied in two double blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of outward F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the doses examined there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with an ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bed 0,1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine to topical application of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with an ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study for der@@ mal application also showed no similar effects in mice for four months . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk to humans due to systemic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers on than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can hurt other people even if these same symptoms have the same symptoms as you do . − If any of the listed side effects may affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● Fe@@ thi@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( genital organs ) and anus ( anus ) . this is a common and slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
&quot; if untreated , it can lead to de@@ formations , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who have been exposed to much of the solar radiation during their lifetime . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other , similar preparations earlier , please inform your doctor about before you start treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream only when the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by rin@@ se with water . o W@@ enden the cream not in@@ wardly attached . o cover the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream not with a band@@ age or patch . o Falls reactions occur at the treated area that will give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cl@@ utter@@ ed , you can continue the treatment . o In@@ form your doctor if they have no normal blood @-@ image &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , fertili@@ zation of the skin or difficulties when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin can be expected . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not previously ) perform . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; breast@@ feeding your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is not known , as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ento enters the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment differ in case of ti@@ lt war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream to the clean , dry skin area with the thi@@ ghs and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
men with cow@@ ard@@ ins under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath it ( see Section 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks each week , apply a sufficient amount of al@@ dar@@ a cream each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist right away if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blu@@ ish spot faster or cause it to feel sleep@@ y .
&quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you , or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you &apos;ve applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time it is a lighter skin reaction , which will end up in about 2 weeks after treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application area ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sc@@ or@@ ming , skin cell destruction , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes to the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , discomfort or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , inflammation of the eye , throat pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or hospital with recovery devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not established , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies are against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction must be treated with care using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as little experience has occurred in respect of resum@@ ption of treatment after a prolonged break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ca and / or anti@@ py@@ chan@@ ka ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients enrolled in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3- study and its extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe wa@@ ve@@ form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , were reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients came to a serum version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with patients aged 5 and older ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in which there was never a serum version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low @-@ antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody levels , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate , and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity . &quot;
&quot; following IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received a further 3,5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined final point , the clin@@ ically significant change summ@@ ari@@ zes for five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development speed after the Z @-@ S@@ core ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed in older patients . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ ogn@@ omy effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity at once @-@ once talent , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurred .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , will gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - unconditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very often ( incidence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Arthritis , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Re@@ duc@@ ed • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent water bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of each patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , if the cancer is &quot; not res@@ e@@ da@@ in@@ able &quot; ( not removed by surgery alone ) and &quot; mal@@ ign . &quot; • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ single &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood type changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of h@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( other medicines for cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the treatment of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle has to be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is extracted from the water and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
&quot; in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated as a first @-@ line therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for over@@ laying epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line therapy of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ single @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the mixed gift and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the duration of the treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first mixed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood picture should be produced before each offering , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te cen@@ sus . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s N@@ adi@@ r or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value prior to treatment &quot;
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose induction a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 , or over the age of 65 , there is an increased risk factor risk . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical studies , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of coag@@ ulation , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ cot@@ ic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ gu@@ ed when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ u@@ ction must be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treat@@ ment@@ - g@@ inn to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g a day ) lead to a reduced number of pancre@@ atic ex@@ cre@@ tions resulting in increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used for high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be avoided at a high dose for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ alog@@ ous an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment begins to catch advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to breast milk exceeds and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed infant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ qu@@ ant , which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking thy@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ form my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received test medication in the arm of the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in relation to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the controller .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise certain fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats attributed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg for taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , none of the patients with relevant weight loss could be observed . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair lift , bow@@ string , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , descending o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fold ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or with breast @-@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ induced nutrition . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant contrac@@ eption to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after giving a single dose of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline in the am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects identified after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain@@ ties . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding potential and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal , overweight individuals without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ pas@@ tic properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin bow@@ el due to co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ische and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , which blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 are evidence of the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those participating in study which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed in both studies for 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin came with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at waist measurement , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after separation of the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing the drug must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking the capsule in connection with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk diet @-@ related complications ( see paragraph 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body &apos;s new eating habits , start your first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat du@@ sting diet . &quot;
&quot; food di@@ aries are effective because you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely fall easier for you to change your eating habits . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
eat gre@@ asy to decrease the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related complications ( see paragraph 4 ) . try to move more before starting taking the capsules .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules , thereby causing more fat to be ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions , which you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you will exceed your fat limit . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a full fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ness , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these companions appear , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;

obesity has influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancer • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of the pack@@ ag@@ ings of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories you use can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as previously , this can mean that your body can not process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize your weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related complications . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
this reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Stra@@ ight physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can daily burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fat du@@ sts and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
&quot; the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong resp@@ ectable rele@@ as@@ ers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy regi@@ mens , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the distribution of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is recommended with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is length@@ ened , or which tend towards such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five chemotherapy regi@@ mens ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , ran@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience in the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were observed as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study resulted in a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in both healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ MA@@ x was 0.@@ 75 mg once again . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified substance made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous in@@ jek@@ tion in healthy eyes the total body size was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular failure and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses used and since Alo@@ xi is used in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is evaluated as low for humans . &quot;

Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are ex@@ cre@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates these to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon producers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference resin . &quot;
&quot; in the study , it was measured how many patients responded after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the CH@@ MP to say permission to mis@@ use ?
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicine to be marketed should not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease res@@ ets more patients than with the reference resin . Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated for examining the question of how the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected ﬁ@@ sh ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not have an effect on these types of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin wounds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a permit for the distribution of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of raising awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected in vi@@ vo due to the low plasma concentrations in humans after topical application ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After a simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dos@@ ages are not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; during the pregnancy , retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ int@@ ment should only be used if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in the administration of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able . &quot;
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation was the place of performance that entered about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the effect mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ ome inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ ome protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ ome P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding adjustment and preventing normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ in@@ ulin was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion to intact skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
&quot; the sample withdrawal was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication , and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot;
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 treated skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure of humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 sand@@ ed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were established . &quot;
&quot; the holder of authorisation for placing the product must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) , works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation for the distribution agreement is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP must simultaneously be submitted with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; if irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms appear at the treated area , you should end the application of al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use any other sal@@ ine , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of view on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a sterile gau@@ ze or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is available in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of ano@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum pou@@ ch containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be carried out from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components , such as the Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the Twin@@ rix Kinder &apos;s approved vaccine since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix took place between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six and a 12 month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 The European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing with Ambi@@ ence consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a vaccine is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a vaccine as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no more trac@@ eable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard protocol with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these injection methods should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously because it can result in bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ de , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that there is no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever is comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ase and preser@@ v@@ ative formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were given Ambi@@ rix to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and seri@@ ousness on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ dose Ambi@@ ence , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ ence at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ ence reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matri@@ ces was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. above the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ ence compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and toxic@@ ity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ence a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ation vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after offering the 3 @-@ dose compound significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the responses reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ des , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and serum conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
&quot; the vaccine is to be investigated both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing , to possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes . &quot;
&quot; according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ borne foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water @-@ contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , has already shown an allergic reaction to you / your child . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B quickly ( i.e. within 6 months , and before the usual dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a de@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened by a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child will take further drugs ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ ence , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not administered , unless they are urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ ence Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; very common ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ness • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite , &quot;
often ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Acc@@ ade@@ dness • ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal conditions
&quot; further adverse events , which were reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 contained doses ) , are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or expanded r@@ ashes that can be it@@ chy or blo@@ cky , swelling of the eye contours and the face , sound breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ tranet , the CH@@ MP has seen that the Ben@@ ef@@ it risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix had been brought into circulation only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ exhaus@@ tible enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - split by several individual boxes to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , an abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was prescribed .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium bi@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients suffering from swal@@ lowing , since there is a risk of the creation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and kidneys is performed , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed irrit@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al female who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with a single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ li@@ cal active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
&quot; as a result , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is commen@@ ced immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many people with mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ on tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , was 98 % survival rate . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are rarely rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after giving a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated amounts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium poly@@ but@@ yl rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lic disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the plasma following night after night fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no har@@ dening effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets yet ) or have a gastro@@ enter@@ al throat or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium bi@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed prior to birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions came into the pyrami@@ ds of the cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al female who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are rarely rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ules form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once and for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication using a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ but@@ yl rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming protein . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , rel@@ ap@@ se of the ear , dis@@ orient@@ edness , memory disorders and a worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood picture ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin irrit@@ ation , skin rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory results . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date on the box and the container after &quot; using until &quot; the exp@@ iry date of the exp@@ iry date .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly over the same single doses or use a ga@@ stri@@ c tube ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose leading through the nose to the stomach ) .
&quot; • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ules . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measure of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the efficacy of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a single application or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was Angi@@ ox - with or without the Gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the distribution of angi@@ ox@@ in throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) during an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a resolution of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of Angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 sec , a second indication of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the intake dose should be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney dysfunction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( if treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din vs. ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is 225 seconds , a second intake dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients Angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even though most of the cases of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din perform most of the bleeding in arter@@ ial points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ator inhibit@@ ors ) it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be monitored regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other &quot; punc@@ tual points , &quot; retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck were other , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) . &quot;
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; Angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ani@@ on compound region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din on Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , in turn , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin can not be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ c@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients ) or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the distribution of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra is used either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously applied in the area of the abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change in effect , the brand ( producer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ related diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the change of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore be changed when switching to the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ g@@ ulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of symp@@ athetic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and spare pin . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin irrit@@ ation occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed in clinical trials reported adverse drug treatments , grouped by system organ classes and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If it fails to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , a light yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a suit@@ ably trained person , or intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; following a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active time is shorter than in hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast impact as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose burning effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; it was evident from the data that a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was inherited 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 Min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ mal mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
