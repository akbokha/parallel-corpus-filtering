<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal tuning."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are also broken down as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibozol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole acts as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its reoccurring."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the re-occurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurring, to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic fluid) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment was examined."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies to manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify was also effective for up to 74 weeks as a placebo to treat manic episodes of previously untreated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for inclusion (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (leakage), nausea, somnolence (drowsiness), nausea and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with mostly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripibozol, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, when oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and related to their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripibozol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors can justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripivotzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripibozol (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide with Aripibozol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripibozol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, over-line disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malign form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials involving a year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurred during the treatment with Aripibozol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripibozol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripibozol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripikezol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"there was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosages, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripibozol treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with etoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyphurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripikezol on the central nervous system, caution is recommended if Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripikezol by 107% while CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripibozol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose-height before the accompanying therapy begins."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be counted with a moderate increase in Aripivotzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripivotzol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data storage for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in animal reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripikezol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total of decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathic, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was observed in patients with Aripivotzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was observed in patients treated with Aripikezol, and 15.1% in patients under Olantiin therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was observed in patients with Aripivotzol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% was observed in patients with Aripivotzol treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment."</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, yielded no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK increases (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripibozol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events associated with antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripibozol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute surgeries with Aripibozol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripibozol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdose, since Aripiprazl has a high plasma retention."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripivotzol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripibozol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1 adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the Nucleus caudatus and the putname."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripivotzol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 of responder patients who contributed to the study meditation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperdol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assen-depression scale, showed significantly greater improvement than with haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher return rate showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripibozol group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olantiin controlled, multi-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripibozol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripibozol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripibozol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a recovery effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripibozol showed a comparable share in patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the escort therapy with Aripibozol resulted in superior efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"in a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripikezol during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripibozol compared to placebo superior to the prevention of a relapse in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylocating of aripibozol, catalyzes N-dealkyylation by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">"the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours with 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites via CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripibozol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripivarzol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis of the liver (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripibozol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin pigments accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the 3 to 10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripibozol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate concentrations found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the study were no longer than 6% of the concentrations found in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro resolution."</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimizing microtubules that promote the conformation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilize the microtubules by inhibiting their decomposing polymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">"this stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions."</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transzytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel in the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transversal endothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unblinded trials and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher in Abraxane (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel and also the distribution volume was higher in Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">"in the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3" -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3 "-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel)."</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Acurase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"apestasis is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the use of apestasis in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had no protease inhibitors has not been proven."</seg>

<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore Ageneric capsules and solution for inserting on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Acurase Capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"2 If Acurase Capsules are applied without the amplifying additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Acurase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied."</seg>

<seg id="1976">"when these drugs are used together, caution is recommended; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be done as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult for Delavirdin."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dispensing of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with aperiasis, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this."</seg>
<seg id="1979">"pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration."</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or Inductors of CYP3A4, may possibly result in interactions between them."</seg>

<seg id="2035">"the evidence of the efficacy of Acurase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, with PI pre-treated adults following virological failure (600 mg twice a day) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"one hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asapase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017."</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferior quality of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adreaded average variation of the output value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non-lower threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">"the evidence of the efficacy of unbundled asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"in the studies, Ageneric solution was used for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of kritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with aperiasis.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value."</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">"therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influenced the extent and rate of resorption."</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of Amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of inbound Amprenavir that represents the active part, probably unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"while absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates depending on the total-drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and present a substrate of CYP3A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the administration of Acurase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Ageneric Solution and Ageneric Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbasis."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicine to be marketed should not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease resets more patients than with the reference resin. Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated for examining the question of how the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected ﬁsh (crack or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provably or presumably caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not have an effect on these types of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was clung after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective in treating abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections which have been provably or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the distribution of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of raising awareness or serious local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully wipes and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected in vivo due to the low plasma concentrations in humans after topical application (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After a simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole, the middle Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin anointment increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin anointment."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosages are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"during the pregnancy, retinapamulin anointment should only be used if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin in the administration of a systemic antibiotic is preferable."</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials to 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo applied, the most commonly reported side effect irritation was the place of performance that entered about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"reapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of retinapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that differs from binding sites of other ribosome interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Bindungsstelle is involved in the ribosome protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosome P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the Peptidyltransfer, partially blocking P-binding adjustment and preventing normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"if, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retinapamulin at least some types of infection appears questionable, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% reapamulin anoinulin was applied daily under occlusion to intact skin for up to 7 days."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be carried out from two doses."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 month gap between the two injections."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with an effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where insulin can not be effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin liscents."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients) or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the distribution of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as subcutaneous injection, Apidra is used either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneously applied in the area of the abdomen."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change in effect, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-related diabetes, can lead to hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore be changed when switching to the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoroxetine, propoxyphene, salicylate and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, symptoms of adrenergic countergulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and spare pin."</seg>

<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a suitably trained person, or intravenous intravenous glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"following a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin the efficiency occurs faster and the active time is shorter than in horsesho- manic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, insulin lulisin showed a proportional glucosal effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast impact as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose burning effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
