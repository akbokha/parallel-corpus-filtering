&quot; although I had visited the US for at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magnet , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interests . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so nicely .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from around the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp Welt@@ anschau@@ ung also agreed not to coinci@@ de with the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our shared love for basketball , and we spent a lot of hours watching the Phoenix &quot; &quot; S@@ uns &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew leak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp beg@@ ged his way to the nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception to rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respect@@ ful , and suggests a inability to understand those who act and think in a different way . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( N.@@ B. ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash word@@ play , as it called the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one likes , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ anist , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , there is a huge part of the White American promise on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now the tru@@ mp country , said the news . &quot;
&quot; all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new American . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura shared ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence . &quot;
&quot; however , after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; young band members are very serious about the music group , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , drums , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located on top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments , composed of local solid waste materials , is made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made of garbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , re@@ members the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
&quot; that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before , a violin produced from rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; records the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , re @-@ publication will take place on the basis of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated underground fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this type on its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to port one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries whom you simply refused &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , re@@ members . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia on account of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
the core of this initiative that crimin@@ alizes criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , who at that time expelled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that we have eight countries like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing have been hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious driving routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a catch license , where they were on the move and possibly even if they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses to the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year due to illegal fishing , which inv@@ ade in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licensing documents , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they pur@@ pos@@ efully use the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You can &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
the closed front works so far .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i identify suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , a leader analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off , for example , their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland is helping to build a system that links different levels of information to each other . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and allows the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that &apos;s simply a sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project that allows a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to be fishing without a license previously and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are being observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i now account for a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tractors on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state of Somalia has been able to announce his first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag , was on the move even without a license and were used as tow@@ ing nets , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the oceans .

&quot; her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to rise : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ conquer the country &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the mandate of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , as they gathered on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recall of Venezuela ) , images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the Bar@@ inas low@@ land region , in the coastal regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centre @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the mandate of current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately blocking a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes in her latest article the context of the decision of the government : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter pictures , which tell of arguments , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national shri@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an info@@ graphic opens the round that covers the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an official settlement procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba , Qui@@ j@@ ano said against his father in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was charged with crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I believed that this was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I couldn &apos;t see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

archive recording .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power a parent has over his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made you friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; just that they don &apos;t take you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become jeal@@ ous . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; at the base of the military base , I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I looked in and saw a couch , where people were tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
&quot; very rarely , they tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it over with water , and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty win@@ try .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied up in hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people mun@@ ched still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me away ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed and killed a man there .
&quot; ( according to survivors the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the path on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mean &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military det@@ ectives that one takes away from an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... it is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , beating me and shou@@ ted : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ ical act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one continues to develop and realize that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but what causes the cor@@ p@@ ses to disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again and again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did not these people also have families who were able to hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ ical act that one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed anywhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; my father said . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
&quot; the idea of showing my father was during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ wardly blown away and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like this ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he said only &quot; &quot; Well , then I show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I got the first advertisement . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach myself that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .
&quot; in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : under severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , in 28 cases sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 accused died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Perm verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all of the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian staff . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have spent years working on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial was established , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto lead to &quot; terrible driving &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license . &quot;
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , witnessed a very dis@@ mis@@ sal translation last month . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word in the &quot; &quot; old car &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; older car &quot; &quot; means , wrong@@ ly - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; translated as &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper published in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the defective English translation was removed at first . the term &quot; &quot; bad drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely hope that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are implic@@ ated nationwide in accidents is quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the published version of the article published on Yahoo delivered comments to the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ w against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How accurate is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills , in order to understand the source text and to transmit active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have a foreign employee themselves , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; portal of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also over@@ took photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , resist@@ ing the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ alled , and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are re @-@ closed by Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; offers such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot;
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO &quot; &quot; VE@@ IT &quot; &quot; later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server responds to error or refuses to request access to such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ an@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was suspended on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage more and more difficult in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to get an education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other cri@@ m@@ tas who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one refers to the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers their min@@ ors son or their inferior daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children do not have to pay a number of days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract which cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organisation fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that their daughter is in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies the exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , was given a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of the former military house of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; organizations such as UN@@ ICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , who were deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , were responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to harm the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean ta .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go all work and began to sell sweets on the street , or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went back home and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house than eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the master had found someone who listened while speaking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; again . &quot;
&quot; her Lord feared that she would lose the education she had allowed her , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about are mo@@ bbing and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to a group . &quot;

society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
&quot; Hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot;
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the authors switched to the display once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas report , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the pre@@ history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , were ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the cant@@ een ( where the workers were treated as a semi @-@ slave ) . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and that of the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian people from Egypt have recently voted to &quot; regulate the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is intended to give citizens permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adoption of the law , users should be registered on the site with their correct names and identity ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application &quot; which is run over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is assumed that the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration on users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook , and it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they forci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated by Parliament and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of says . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , a parliamentary deputy , proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those ordered to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization of Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining beast in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the free wild run@@ way is low and goes towards zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wild animals in Kurdistan Region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the regional daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress that had been hit in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ cill@@ ors Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost whole coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , so 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
the report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( on the other hand , on the other hand ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare homes were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light of 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from shel@@ ters ( on the other hand , on the other hand , in order to move cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still more than 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of those who were evacu@@ ated in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of those evacu@@ ated after the disaster in shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools afflicted by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors up to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i ports are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have suffered large @-@ scale suffering . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far defeated . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it seems more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to establish a general picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , taking measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst disaster @-@ caused , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the state of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated ones still live in Beh@@ el@@ aid shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old . they are not@@ e@@ worthy because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater initially than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode from In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ vil@@ man explains how a walk has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police on nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit last Friday during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stick against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active service . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officers , how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire suppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers hurry to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

police gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where last Friday led to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported about a broken glass window to make illustr@@ ative arrangements with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing . &quot;
you must also recognize this if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ induc@@ ement Un@@ forgotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory lost its plant until only the steel and concrete ru@@ mo@@ urs remained . &quot;
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some were changing the job .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene is re@@ members of the fact that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for rest@@ lessness in the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the congregation saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose over a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first release , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was passed on and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the still @-@ read sugar cane factories , &quot; &quot; he asser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work station producer has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for the employment and services that the plants generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to protest , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ing the street , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other factories . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without any prospects for the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine slain are bringing the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month , to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at the age of 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this via Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated with ten C@@ ree communities in Northern Que@@ bec and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop thus raises the young participants in talks with topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; as the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribal of the Kit@@ ag@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the youths involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , there is a tran@@ script available , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody is ever interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you are going to forgive our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and grow as our youth as well . &quot;
this is how they can do that for which they have determined the Creator .
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the stop@@ per into sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( on the other hand , on the other hand ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( on the other hand , &quot; Plas@@ tics models of dishes &quot; ) are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the town of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new coated mobile rib@@ bons to be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji To@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some sho@@ oters with fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , an Imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple containing your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a is used or salmon @-@ che@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
some users had doubts on Twitter :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with salmon ? &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
further quir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 on the other .
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the Mis@@ sing and Get@@ ting regularly appear only in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses , such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every skel@@ eton in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning to live with drug trade &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and all communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; ) tells these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here also with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are we to get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in statistics .
&quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; so@@ oth@@ ed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : as a family has been lo@@ oted with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals s@@ nat@@ ched money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days , I asked myself whether weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist , Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega , published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement at the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make an egg cooking , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against it had been mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Om@@ bud@@ sman for Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ our or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been used to make trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , turning around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for many years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , it fell victim to that of the tan@@ ker lor@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; officials discussed a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup champi@@ onships . &quot;
&quot; houses were scattered , and pla@@ stered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets . &quot;
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to lack of recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies which are lined up on the ground while individuals view them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been imposed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported a dr@@ astic increase in atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only using satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack remains un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the extent of the attack : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented arrangements to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as evidence for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely illustrate the image of DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , bringing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , wrong@@ ly claimed in 2012 , the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of DR Congo to get this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also mistakenly wrote Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not connected the image of DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere in the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , platforms social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , some have tried to un@@ mask the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive exploitation and associated them with the respective countries , based on what they had been published on which side they were published . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are inter@@ connected ) , several examples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be completely broken ( on the map in orange ) :

examples of false coupl@@ ings of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries are still available on pages or servers , over the examples of fak@@ es or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to demonstrate fal@@ si@@ fication samples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names the mis@@ information , but also discusses the abuse of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the involved trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; there are clearly no sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from DR Congo was a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted to deli@@ ri@@ ze , since the photos were ab@@ u@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar &apos;s government published a lev@@ elling on what it meant as &quot; &quot; deliberately hidden messages and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this lev@@ elling , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors running H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and migr@@ ate to the other ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news site mistakenly claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have admitted that monks and politicians were involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the p@@ liers &apos; picture .
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication , the picture is still included in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
&quot; when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Paris and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese were translated into circulation . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture was contained in DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ eye also points to other accounts , generators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally have image data names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and humili@@ ate the real horror of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent ima@@ gery can des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which is actually also detached from context or completely impro@@ per way . &quot;
&quot; however , every investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the vat language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pain@@ ted yourself around your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts , and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages that are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of floods and land@@ slides in this decade .
&quot; caused by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ ay@@ am and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge av@@ alan@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe resi@@ dences . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly returned . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels up to 7.5 m . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for anyone who wants to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; today , please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area . &quot;
the taxi call @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the cad@@ ence center is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eval of help and donations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring residents to security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

women &apos;s March in San Francisco on 21 January 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; use appro@@ g@@ t.@@ At the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust you my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we &apos;ll have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they have mi@@ tig@@ ated me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who , as I do not fit in there , will be mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
to be un@@ muscular
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think about when you think of him ?
love ?
to be in peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in Western terms , the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground @-@ breaking Palestinian American scientist Edward S@@ aid crushed the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to bridge them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narrative domin@@ antly dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that had led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate for 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi women to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rower weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it is seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans who were brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create fo@@ ols which help us understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ ain@@ tly failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ American .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my beloved parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ miss@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims bear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we don &apos;t wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information that is our already fla@@ wed image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger , who breaks down a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our belonging .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they win a competition of the art of floral arrangements in Kar@@ achi three decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted by Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a cor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims consists in how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ die @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my beloved grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family , whom he was not allowed to close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to this is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first pilot bomb of history was cast down over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ an under@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion things goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ recognized history .
&quot; it means to remember that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went into Iraq to pursue mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy goes home to the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two @-@ way &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural Islam hos@@ tility is in Muslim registri@@ es that started with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ fly list , &quot; which is mainly targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we carry , and the bombs we throw to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
conversations that we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous forms that we are ste@@ aling in our news auctions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our often @-@ known identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global moment in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling it here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people were enth@@ used by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , even scientific of Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ com@@ fy questions about the role of consciously and deliberately perpet@@ u@@ ate the &quot; other &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and me in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , in which we have no president , will go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
story@@ telling initiative wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure rooms where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; while &quot; listening often is associated to understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listen , &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , historians tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and representation will lead to the fact that the audience is engaging in it . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona , Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ rank , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling tours . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new review of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march launched at the Republi@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old part of San Ju@@ ana . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil war for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ attachment of debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held ac@@ countable for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not settle down with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the territory of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an anti @-@ government non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth &quot; . &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin , an event was devoted to the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of papers dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real costs are with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about its present state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing that Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up from times of extreme convic@@ tions in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military facility . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; &quot; had taken on the basis of a command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes were for@@ esi@@ ghted as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el had not yet known that ten years after working with this work , the IS would do everything to eradic@@ ate this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ en but the world . &quot;
this stri@@ pe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail : &quot;
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in prison .
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , G@@ haz@@ i is the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ cu@@ book that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind at the moment when we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care for any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I rings in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; I had a passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
during the day
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested , or forci@@ bly moved by the regime , were tortured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been in custody since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release release on previous post
&quot; with anger , Mozambique re@@ acted against a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ vo@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants on account of em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , their Council , Cam@@ ba@@ za , between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its rein@@ statement in the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , since the company did not undertake disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have introduced disciplinary proceedings against the conflic@@ ting ones .
&quot; however , the company apparently kept silent and did not take reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contrary &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after having been sentenced to prison and half of which has been dropped . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ents to become re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
this is the case !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young musli@@ m and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t have any moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za rewarded the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za fails to return to morality and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man , who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ al@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are members of the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is able to sell also the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ or@@ ah also said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . it changes the tactics , but it does not turn away from its ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he mis@@ ses money , puts it under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ λ@@ α@@ λ@@ ι@@ α ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to German : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mos@@ ambique Di@@ eb and servant of the # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced for long @-@ term imprisonment , returns to # Air@@ ports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network took up its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , Bur@@ m@@ ese chair is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cle@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the following words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to li@@ king , post and share content for 24 hours , because the mail &quot; did not meet Facebook Community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech away from Facebook .
&quot; in the post office , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they gave them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now use Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but were nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure , the balancing act of hate on its Bur@@ m@@ ese parties . &quot;
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the nursery

the pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law to ban this practice so that the age of emplo@@ yable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this amend@@ ment of the marriage law some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 the Chief of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , every human being under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the National Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which endea@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws on child marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u guide , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition stir@@ red up tensions in this actually un@@ complicated affair , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; yet in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and proclaim the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
&quot; after having been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on pa@@ edi@@ atric marri@@ ages have finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who suffers a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? childhood is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ey Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
&quot; the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , regardless of the religious affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the draft for amend@@ ment of the marriage law today , on 9 June 2017 , was approved . &quot;
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the voting .
&quot; all the depu@@ ties , who were against it , voted for the law . &quot;
it is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mal@@ ag@@ ei@@ shiel@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a Thank you to our depu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best known Hind@@ u organisation . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired , one would approach the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; rather , instead of speaking of the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , we would say that the state , our daughters , would be mis@@ used , would be mis@@ used , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court proceeding against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different levels , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ de with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day , the website of the prosec@@ utor of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was hack@@ ed . the hack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Abi@@ de home . &quot; &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the news was removed from the site - but in the cache it remained . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced Y@@ ar@@ News &apos;s local news service that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can see Wikipedia &apos;s content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series fight against the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using res@@ etting tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia for 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet took place since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names , making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content , however , is available in spite of legal prohibition . &quot;
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ ck@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this move was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the barrier . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a Su@@ hl@@ ende N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
the motivated him to carry a camera himself and to try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to gr@@ ind pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so sc@@ ary as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he had already set tig@@ ers face to face , saying , &quot;
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
&quot; late in the evening , the light is too weak . &quot;
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ggy appeared . he sits down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and lived six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ bar and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid using the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure and fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married acquain@@ tance with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of calling their wives also not by name is common among men . however , they have far less allow@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club , thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ned for the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the disclosure of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in its panel discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify .
not to speak lou@@ dly the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all feel guilty and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say their husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day they had the names of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never allowed the names of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of her during the whole exercise , and another decided to release the entire fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed at her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every disc@@ us club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these issues for so many years now and yet I have never said so honestly about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ one Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own coat choice , morality is linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
so far we have only taken small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , still make it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ schen for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
every one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative tag
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on the 29th of June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the &quot; &quot; Beat@@ les Memorial Day &quot; &quot; in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today , the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day is in Japan . &quot;
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll plays John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly in the year 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen @-@ no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
that &apos;s how the day is going on today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; follow the H@@ ash@@ tag , on the other hand , on the other hand , to learn more about the Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day . &quot;
bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks .
&quot; photo : An@@ other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of people of bald people for the organic trade , probably for un@@ believing purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from Malawi &apos;s border . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a man of a bald man can unlock gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men in Mozambique have been registered .
&quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country carried out a mission in the South African country , to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; be@@ ware of bald men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police waited for the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; hus@@ band@@ ry Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rison bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has given mission to the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bet@@ tor ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the wealth generation . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I would like to invite E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME A country in which the people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good notes , and to take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for un@@ believing ends or &quot; black magic &quot; are ch@@ ased out . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ itz@@ y : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of the people of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who had out@@ lived himself as the insi@@ ders of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials experienced that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Foreign Office in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; internal issue &quot; and told a speaker that he deemed it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ed up some foreign reactions .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway and the rest
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government shared that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume fishing trips to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as she shared in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans would &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , insofar as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy issued an angry response from China , with the foreign ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; the German spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; prior to diplomatic sources in Beijing , the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and the United Kingdom
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u Ms. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us about :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , uph@@ old and appro@@ ve the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there was no further information about whether France would finally receive it . &quot;

the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan challenged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in a statement on June 28 , around Li@@ u , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this observation has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the International Bran@@ ch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people comm@@ itting a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately not a land . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of fle@@ eing from the responsibilities , a duty of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old bodies appear again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leave the distorted logic , as they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers given to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ rep@@ lies to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system . &quot;
he clo@@ aked the appropriate questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , provided he was paid high in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that you should start reading the whole heading of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the heading .
&quot; when he said Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as a leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ iden &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully committed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian deb@@ tor ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , are we only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay the bill to our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade des Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world to be exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices , Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook a lot of anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that makes us different Canadi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans put a Canadian flag on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; on the other hand , Americans ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling through the world twenty years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons at all !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; everyone seems to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; very often . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys are south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; for example , I wouldn &apos;t make a mistake if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major achievement of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band known in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man , who tells the rules his girlfriend owns . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video nevertheless indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief absolute discretion on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; alter@@ ing the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critic by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was established , the online content monitors and persons accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy , was prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict statement against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( insul@@ t of the Maj@@ estic offensive ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup by the army .
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games of Pan@@ em &quot; who had already been used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
