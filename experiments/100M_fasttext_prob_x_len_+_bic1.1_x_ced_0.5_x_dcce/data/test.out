28 year old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the Nig@@ eri@@ an Department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shocked and destroyed by his death .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia insisted that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things were going uphill for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone , who would hurt his younger brother . &quot;
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; to connect with his family was to cook us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the call of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or I get stuck from outside labels , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend their time at home , in front of TV with local de@@ bris and mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; on the white draft , she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all @-@ moving mother of two sons . &quot;
the film ends with us on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a change on the beach with some colleagues . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyrami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career then ended again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again close to horses . &quot;
he let himself be guided by his family via the AL@@ RV site . on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photo purposes .
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and so also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Py@@ ramid of Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver leaf lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
a long one is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social engagement . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not involved in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate his death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will drive regul@@ ators massive , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would increase for the rich , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in which we must invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost elo@@ qu@@ ent . &quot;
the democratic applicant is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs into the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical apar@@ theid wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp there could be party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining back to the United States .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly expand and demand renew@@ ables with their investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we are . &quot;
&quot; but not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ d trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , they do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this matter is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is necessary , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics regard him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; every one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and is dealing among other things with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
&quot; in the Munich North , they live in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ born women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has opened up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope @-@ makers to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they fall in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single @-@ standing women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to an estimated 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich , traumati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations just for them , B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone wing@@ ed women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors in some common shel@@ ters or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it reads : &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ually - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the Regi@@ stra@@ sts have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had ab@@ dic@@ ated to address the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; persi@@ sted calm@@ ly &quot; &quot; would have had problems , which led to the agreement to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council today to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures beginning in September . &quot;
&quot; this year , the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck this year six times , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of the BM@@ A Assistance physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana , retired after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which still took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ ants and Medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara is most willing to reconci@@ le this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were sli@@ pper@@ y and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if it was never a bad thing . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was hot .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
leaving was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara for months . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could win a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was released last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ ju@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , as its reaction to the attempted power takeover is regarded as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the persistent gru@@ dge is coming across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which even has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y the &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described as an analy@@ st : two countries who feel bad and treated badly and are now f@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents reported at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even understand the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided addressing a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , as NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank CEO , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office roll . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head@@ quarter and the stock exchanges will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
&quot; during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re . &quot;
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor @-@ brand as well as the brand under which our employees are employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Mar@@ ches , because how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th gain in New@@ market at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British winning at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is also here &quot;
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he brings victory to Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career horses &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma lovers for years for this kind of sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already claimed 6.000 profits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years winner in UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dut@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties initially when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to its best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 10 years of age .
Russian Putin che@@ ats Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly dismissed Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest trust of Putin . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin had ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without giving reason . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his substitute since 2012 , became his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious International Relations Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it reads ( in Russian ) that he was later the protocol manager and chief executive of the government staff . &quot;
he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retired at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now - just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust in ridi@@ culous posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal on Thursday . &quot;

ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the Ban@@ ff garden
a villa@@ in of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that di@@ pped in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be a sand e@@ ale in the 75 fish that were sp@@ her@@ ed out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , on Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approxim@@ ates the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown re@@ port@@ edly paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a ju@@ g@@ gling for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - they were just a few milli@@ meters on each side . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm on Friday , after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in safety , while their boat was moving from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat turned around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bow hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are luck@@ ier and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
badly injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ ized killer cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street she met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building houses of Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens believe that investors should be taken much more seriously in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed , shall provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is no agreement at the moment between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prec@@ ep@@ ts as possible .
the left wants to make even harder runs for investors .
&quot; not@@ withstanding that , as viol@@ as , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled staff .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how to compensate for the loss of more around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out@@ going b@@ ind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ thought to get apartments back to the price tag . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; because in the western city , deadlines are running at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing estate companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west town is increased dras@@ tically again , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; commenting on the situation , S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness which is worth it &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time running on screens , was compla@@ ined by many during the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on TV , then video games and finally limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later this resulted in a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the line and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that re@@ fut@@ ed the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train every day 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly exercise sport , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships on hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ elling players who have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast scre@@ amed on Thursday to the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world ahead of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ dic@@ ine winner in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the solo competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who wins a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , while consoli@@ dating her reputation , the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision , that the 1984 Olympic champion from 1984 said that she is &quot; &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting it to be a final examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between balance and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ contest in@@ ale of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party . &quot;
&quot; although worth it , while their long way to the top , never planned to have the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last so long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina slightly led through two turns , the picture sh@@ ook . &quot;
floating beams and ground ropes - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
&quot; she again brought again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her sof@@ tly than they expected her grand@@ ness - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed onto bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ da@@ ille went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ schafts@@ capit@@ ain , which is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their soil exercise , she threw open fire to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ings shot while listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot who died in one of the dead@@ liest ass@@ aults of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a predat@@ ory assault , as the attack@@ er didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look , whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in H@@ is@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used multiple vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness shared the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it will be better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the fe@@ west of his ages , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage this .
I didn &apos;t let myself slip on that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first response to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to run a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth presents the sign language , which Ed@@ mund has devised for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency stand . it is expected all Saturday over with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards explained that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the communities concerned .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ p system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service showed that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a threat , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people from floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , increased greatly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and pouring in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was spreading rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been completely absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood of floo@@ ding and sand bags for residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison County said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported flooded , but on Friday no one was reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ lying by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police say that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents believed that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and stomach , but that in his transport he was in the hospital with consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done much , his small body was bul@@ lied by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ caster that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had been a bon@@ fire between several guns .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ ded the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters that were very active , &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police station in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross gun at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is catho@@ lic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally ech@@ oes the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but not so do sports classes across the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the Last Five , because the next Olympic team will have only four female runners in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ner is a costly sport and is primarily in private gymnas@@ tics that are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these sne@@ akers are located in wealthy suburbs to support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the communities of countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible sports training . &quot;
I founded my sports foundation of 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to care for the turns and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for starting their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 Assist@@ ants who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistants are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend works to improve the care for un@@ interrupted times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee of Assist@@ ants announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns regarding the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current workforce crisis and meeting it to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks insti@@ gated by the government for reluct@@ ance to participate , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
this was what Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done last month about the fact that his door would always be open .
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now to raise the burden and address the worries of the assistance physicians .
&quot; should he not do this , the Assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better weekly salary for the 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , requested the assistance doctors to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not achieve anything that little , but already bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months we spoke to the Committee of Assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training courses , additional training for those who were returning from a vocational training period , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug when recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the surface breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ICE &apos;s introductory draft , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Healthcare Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively reduces heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness allows election fraud to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was released last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , acc@@ uses the police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , now an answer king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside of bal@@ lot cabins to protect frigh@@ tened voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a proof of themselves , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to apply re@@ mo@@ ve@@ able ink to a person &apos;s finger when they give up their vote , in order to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election scandal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the reign@@ ing Mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man allegedly &quot; &quot; led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person as someone else chooses . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal election - with the older members of the Muslim community , having put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding outs to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; his report states that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been applied , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists process brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; &quot; elections &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider choices to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for arbit@@ ration .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists process complete post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes .
the police have the authority to set off shut @-@ outs for election stations .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Repres@@ tung Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing prohibited in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English is allowed in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees usually assert that voters are entering the election cabin alone . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; of the electoral registration departments of the town halls . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The Supreme Court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; as the mother of parliam@@ ents , our country bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French bicycle sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ companion of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by no means the only Ath@@ lete , who is fighting for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ pping on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resem@@ b@@ lance to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ate &apos;s double @-@ tran@@ sig@@ ent on the bike race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a t@@ witter account after images on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ c@@ anny .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one hall@@ way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
&quot; another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : foot@@ star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the similarities .
&quot; theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympics ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer dies &quot; as a pig died

&quot; the Canadian television station C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; as M@@ ief &quot; &quot; went off and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he dropped his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m clearance squ@@ ad@@ ron .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was caught in the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , left as M@@ ief , died as a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m clearance squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard at which many were talking to him
&quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard , how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # be@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC exc@@ used for 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ itus via Twitter &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed as well and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at the show and our followers in social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by women who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman with@@ drew her clothes in the middle of a mark to try his pants . &quot;
&quot; to make the situation worse , she scrut@@ in@@ ised her , as she looked at it , pulled off and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone where the woman pro@@ bed the pants before putting her back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the position , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to come back and out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants that she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how re@@ fut@@ able to think that someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had left her and pulled out and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against attacks of arms
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ ber around the sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike him with his knee in the body , and twist the weapon out of his hands , while the attack@@ er is cro@@ oked before pain . strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight on the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before it moves backwards and turn the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ tends to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that a rob@@ bery is the saf@@ est to hand over your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ows his tongue for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ drew his immune system and Wür@@ r@@ ef@@ lex in a serious test - by det@@ ecting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sha@@ ved his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ging button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before dropping any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to leak a toilet flush , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; luckily , nothing left what he had , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate curious as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to train stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely to a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their L@@ umin@@ ometer rating was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have heard in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming so that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had told him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things where it was easier to make Ian , lick it and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty tricks on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cious family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cking employees found property in an irre@@ parable condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls laid bare holes , wooden boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had caused , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; there were drugs in the estate , in which drugs were traded in the past . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ iled her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
del@@ o@@ ids were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were conven@@ ed at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added , &quot; &quot; It is a shame that the les@@ see ab@@ uses to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family as a del@@ o@@ iling is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing considers . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work done by my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti@@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ oning on the ground
workers in the house management will now need rub@@ b@@ ish rub@@ b@@ ish mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 police attacked a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash amounting to £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after ow@@ ning itself to the owner of a class B drug in commercial for@@ esi@@ ght .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that they are les@@ bians that do not comply with the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police shared that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without repro@@ ach , as well as to those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists arrive in panic in Portugal after an eff@@ ected military jet flies over the beach
&quot; sun@@ worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air strike forces placed an unbelievable storm
&quot; the air strikes announced that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after a ti@@ dy jet@@ ty would drop over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video footage shows how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up , understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the bushes , without seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was surfing right now and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to identify them . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the area , but the air strikes continued to insist that safety at no time was endangered . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , with four people on the island Madeira to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - so deep , which limits its vision &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights for the first step towards the first win in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back@@ lash is three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must abst@@ ain from the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who cont@@ ests with Brazil as the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e has also been missing . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , thus clari@@ fying the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the first time in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for status as number one for two years .
&quot; in this respect coach Luis En@@ rique wai@@ ved a clear decision in this regard and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications is the first step . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish Master has doubts about the fitness of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool . &quot;
&quot; even at 3 : 2 at the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing . &quot;
&quot; Sevilla , again , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat following an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far 11 successes , Barcelona is the record winner of this race . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup first awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ kind@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made themselves the title of each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five @-@ rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no aches . &quot;
they had pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their se@@ ed@@ lings on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches up to here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang was logical . &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
&quot; through the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match did not develop . &quot;
but nevertheless sufficient breath @-@ taking ballo@@ ons were to be seen .
Mi@@ kind@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ White had pulled a rib@@ cage injury and after that was in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be satisfied with metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis holders Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states , to lose their majority . &quot;
&quot; presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now gave short@@ com@@ ings of his campaign in the present Republi@@ can strongh@@ old , U@@ tah . &quot;
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after being thrown out of the race 16 rivals in his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts arise in his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians asking for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; failing to blame false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
republi@@ can high @-@ bur@@ sts w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by the Sur@@ vey@@ or in June , Tru@@ mp and his rival followed by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it does not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to withdraw funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the Republi@@ can candidates would be more likely to attack the Congress than the poor . &quot;
Olympic : three @-@ part fraud on dop@@ ing tests
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee was informed immediately to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , found a urine sample at the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ y@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case to do its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions taken by IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and declared himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , who signed and signed the test , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan team leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against athletes of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing violations , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio Games , more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio Games were previously indicated that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia have been targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically hired .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then expelled from the summer games .
the West Side Story with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli will surprise you . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the bat@@ on of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor , Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members her love with Tony , while younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; says Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Sah@@ ar@@ ans went to New York , and the New York habit@@ ants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as then . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ ywood group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from eastern London asc@@ ended to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
&quot; in case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land , Rei@@ d says that Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presi@@ dency of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to &quot; choose &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a Rei@@ d spokes@@ woman later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land , and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Republi@@ can blocked the Gar@@ lands nomin@@ ee , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; Women and For Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ aner together to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distinguishes as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he thinks it does the calendar also . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ ness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting appeal in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not conform to and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany comp@@ utes with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already crossed Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts before months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the stained put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will start to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
this will allow Erdo@@ gan to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Union demanded that the Federal Government be &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum holders recognised in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 percent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey there is no wage war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; according to the Basic Law , asylum seekers are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer @-@ election campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia cannot vote the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the parliament vote will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid to date it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election warri@@ ors , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and counting at the end of voices just gr@@ asp@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people over it . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D is cut off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alism .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did his legendary word @-@ like predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , Seel@@ ey has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel has the blame on the flowering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time it is the right place for election campaigns . &quot;
she has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations ; Angela Merkel is in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other German states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is also a shame no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual voting conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the Union has noticed that on the land , the base is crum@@ bling away so that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the counsel of the CD@@ U campaign co@@ ke Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , the S &amp; D Group last saw 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should make the leap into the country day . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of vacation , and move largely to the Internet in their campaign campaigns . &quot;
&quot; online election campaign &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local stimul@@ ants among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : catering facilities suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there is all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site was moved to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the subject of the commen@@ cement of the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to setting up facilities for accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was migr@@ ated to the south on Monday and the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted , and so the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation within the town has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now ride from O@@ fan@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
cre@@ denti@@ al traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; &quot; says the vice @-@ manager Florian King responsible for the vice @-@ traffic management of the rehabilitation project . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were a lot of cre@@ eping paths and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ tically involved .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ rides , &quot; says King , who himself made himself the position himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest was on the way with 77 kilometers of kilometers in the speed 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that the road again is open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales break@@ through@@ s , allows everyone to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; running documents are missing . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; in terms of sales revenue , it succ@@ eeds in &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
the street painting has been thrown back for two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant profit otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
&quot; at all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are passing by less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t go here , it &apos;s really nice . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his trunk @-@ click returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work .
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a condition of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically acceptable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I &apos;m also involved in this .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was on results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapons rights .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has launched a second attempt for proposals that have not yet to be done with the SPD : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups and b@@ ang jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything , which does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partially in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before deportation .
&quot; refugees , who are pur@@ pos@@ efully caught in the country , should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts to a security check . &quot;
&quot; in case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tioned .
some of them are still und@@ et@@ ected and leave questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example , the question arises : what exactly does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the massac@@ res of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with , were not cl@@ inging out in election times as well . &quot;
the inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus .
&quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high rise between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ tic dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the chiefs also call for a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling with irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he held nothing . &quot;
we have addressed the discussion in Germany .
re@@ plen@@ ish it is not useful .
&quot; and in a b@@ anning ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; if its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , it must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in it that could cause quar@@ rels .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attempting to pro@@ long itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk carefully and says , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still off lightly .
&quot; in spite of diesel scar@@ ves , delivery numbers rise worldwide . &quot;
but it is not in all markets .
&quot; in the recall campaign , there is confusion around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen enters the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
&quot; despite the diesel , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can further forward a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales , as the company announced in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann pushed the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , a purchase restra@@ int was given in some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas grid first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the predominantly concerned domestic brand of Lower Saxony is anyway further off lightly by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is be@@ ech@@ o@@ ed . &quot;
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales up from January to July .
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen has been tam@@ pered with a software exhaust test .
&quot; in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; following the retro@@ fitting of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car manufacturer has a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate after the conversion , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot;
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW had full capacity to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; deviations thereof are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power , no deterior@@ ations will take place after the retro@@ fit and all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as stated in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen can see the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in customer interest , too , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal@@ ous scandal may result in uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations , as stated . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich as@@ par@@ ag@@ us future criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; there are only 139 customers who can park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; do not have to fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to return from September to September by private and corporate customers for deposits over € 100,000 in sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the future , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause an increase of 0.4 percent , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million € 4,000 . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs now continue . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the association association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to bear them alone , be &quot; economically viable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ s- und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with interest rates for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits on deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; is a clientele that is a bit more luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the association association Bayern , which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition was tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not have noticed that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ itting to the comment section , to skip it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ario men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild stu@@ d@@ ded before I stand , hold my hands and say something better like : &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three men middle @-@ aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I guess was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pipe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are looking to buy their old plates again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record revision of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers received an impetus from the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to reti@@ re to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that awake happ@@ ier rejo@@ icing . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a sheet pile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to it . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I leaf@@ ed through a pile of bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of people : three men middle @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead cou@@ pler to put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produc@@ t@@ less , less musi@@ c@@ ranked . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged teenagers . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts offers new synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz vo@@ iced out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but some psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it &apos;s more like a window shopping than a big shopping mall .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I &apos;m giving the impression to sample the jeans pants pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are looking for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking of buying a Cro@@ sley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; Platten@@ kunst . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer over demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would have a fire and san@@ itation risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that the provisional business and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally run @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migran@@ ts estimated that the number of refugees in the Dsch@@ ungel@@ ell@@ ager rose to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers in the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ culp@@ tors are to be carried out particularly effectively . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic acting enforcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed pol@@ ishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide with a stationary gl@@ itter for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complicated . &quot;
&quot; the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measuring operation , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected over multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access prohibited by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved with a trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed away , it is lowered in the measuring operation so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear snap @-@ proof outer man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after picking up Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji shared a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ da@@ ille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fiji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they only lost one .
&quot; this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji started wonderful and dropped the G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 up , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au gr@@ ung@@ ed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he transformed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a present@@ able T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it just stopped . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a had a touch down in the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning , and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
this is the way it is .
&quot; GB carried out fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant Inter@@ play from Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for the UK , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ an sul@@ an , whose fans sang , sw@@ inging flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged himself and GB ki@@ cked down in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; in earlier days , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ opping inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that &apos;s what they mean .
&quot; from the first strokes up to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve who go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; there were three voices in the boat even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present when they rowed the second Olympi@@ ad in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9th un@@ har@@ assed deployment , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no one more condu@@ ci@@ ve than the trainer , who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that is the right concept at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with it , went to talk a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the cent@@ uri@@ on of the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked with . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a solid thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let itself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian far &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
a little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia do@@ omed the purpose .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe ev@@ ens &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , stands for 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , recalled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water attend@@ ant in 1985 and was appointed president of the ken@@ nel in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency missions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and initiation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and reimbur@@ sement of the farmers , the renewal of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no dead@@ lock , and you have always taken new additions , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation , they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has settled the water @-@ purpose association regularly , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Wasser@@ forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water attend@@ ant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ construction and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the pipeline at Kirch@@ zer on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained once only because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and killed them mort@@ ally .
&quot; the man called himself with us and told him to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald spot . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he can still carry the weapon with him , such as the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S is supposed to call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a duty of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more , &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ depl@@ eted and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; the Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) , said : &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; according to this , the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry was threatened by additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG conversion rate is 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ determination .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written . &quot;
the successful endea@@ vor of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , as the world &apos;s largest producer of products , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand , threw masses of steel onto the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China rose . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; finally , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the crowd went back for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and living , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; since S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; due to regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs with older people w@@ akes up a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth . &quot;
&quot; through song lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia @-@ related people ab@@ re@@ ate to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people , who live alone , do not just focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
&quot; also , the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir . &quot;
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will improve and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - for 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound comes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; if someone is singing from the acquain@@ tance of a senior choir , you can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church officials directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help in internet research . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the help of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the che@@ wing also did not leave the males cold - however , they kept themselves in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat bab@@ ys at the che@@ wing of the chi@@ cks .
&quot; they respond to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , ten percent faster than those found in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; cr@@ aters also react to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ams differs from the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were introduced to a herd of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were lifted up additionally . &quot;
the researchers consider their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off . &quot;
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; ahead of the du@@ el of the arch @-@ riv@@ ets between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected . &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len which one is responsible for the coup attempt .
&quot; in doing so , it is not possible even before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency , which has been suspended for 90 days , is still valid until October , but actually this has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of the Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military stimul@@ i . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &apos; Gala &quot; , &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with 17 gates and nine designs in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it was only 6 . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we have done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year &apos;s year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season winners as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ret@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez bor@@ rowed by AC Florence under contract and proclaimed to Bes@@ ik@@ tas was announced after the coup attempt , not to return to the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the Stür@@ mer should be willing to ren@@ ounce to about a third of its annual estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay its salary at Florence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of dop@@ ing , these athletes still have medals for Olympic in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the focus of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing lock compla@@ ined about the games just before the games , was pi@@ tied off at her start ( 100 m chest ) and rested . &quot;
&quot; it offered a bizarre scene : with a set smile , she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a celeb@@ r@@ atory note that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a whi@@ rl@@ wind . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other athletes , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the second @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain through Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Championships , has been positively tested by the banned stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly ing@@ es@@ tion and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , regre@@ t@@ ted Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been recognized as many medals at a later stage . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 to nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , he received the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ der and ran off already on 13 July . &quot;
earthquake terror in Thailand - Austrian hur@@ ts - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , was first explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , two explo@@ sives were set up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also Ph@@ u@@ ket reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ onation near the popular seaside resort of Pat@@ ong .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing one city cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower shop before the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ chard Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it was too early to manifest itself as possible motives , but it was probably the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; the authorities would have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country over the last few days , but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is standing behind the attacks .
&quot; the police told their officials around the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be any necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence also in the coming years .
&quot; the jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos , while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is able to benefit himself to restore the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not manage to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok in a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Protection Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are in extrem@@ ist way de@@ fam@@ ed . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and &quot; loss of identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; is already observed . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it is , &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; he said , he did not know . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at some point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such individuals have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this connection . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other legitimate groups or small groups form attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognis@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups were developed on the regional level or in social networks .
Mao expressed concern that many attacks came to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum lod@@ gings were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or left who , however , radic@@ alised themselves by far @-@ right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic cre@@ sts or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance by Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 starts . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men run in ae@@ dic@@ s , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media referred to him as &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ b@@ i cat@@ ered for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
&quot; f@@ rene@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before Olympic for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been stolen .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der had left their business on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; as they returned the next morning at 8 : 15 PM , the cash register had disappeared approximately 250 Euro . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tru@@ mp is not so close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
&quot; thus he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post climbs into the trade with electric @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oters as well .
&quot; in brief , the Group intends to start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of the coming year , the post office wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether it should be delivered to its self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ managing director Jürgen Ger@@ ard had said that there are always requests , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ da announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long run , make a complete transition to the environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K leadership steps down after dis@@ appointing business figures
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the returns came suddenly , but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will become even more in@@ secure , the longer the successes promised by him remain . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after renewed dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of the company leadership , the worldwide number five of the industry faces a new beginning . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the supervisory board with effect on September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the management of the Executive Board will take over the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ inger , divided the company . &quot;
he should officially assume the position of a &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
&quot; as a reason for the decl@@ ines , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation . &quot;
details did not want to call a spokesman on Friday .
&quot; in future , those who will lead the market research company will remain unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was said that on Friday , with the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago was great . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent at 72@@ 1.2 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s lower value in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into tren@@ ches in tren@@ ches : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injury , told the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to avoid its details to an opposite truck , which was partly on the opposite track . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured passengers were brought back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum by a regular bus .
&quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus for the travel company . &quot;
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the charges per cubic meter are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the wastewater system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvements are needed . &quot;
&quot; after a clou@@ dy calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the Federal Council Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , he found that under @-@ covers for these sewage installations . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ t@@ berg will have to intervene more deeply into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the charges are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period may also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt explained the severe fees in charge of relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste water , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect on the basis of the low distribution basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , not least due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses had fallen in a considerable scale . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ t@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the written maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste of waste in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were thoroughly penet@@ rated .
&quot; in the past 20 years , Schmidt added that the market community has spar@@ ed large entertainment costs in the sewage installations over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater association cannot be expanded because it is concerned with defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria marks the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 amounted to -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the pre @-@ month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is un@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ ses come to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of using the app black face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week gave some users a filter that gave them slot eyes , false teeth and infl@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were spread widely on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail grace as@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely spread , that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting &quot; &quot; and said least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was drawn into the turning extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older counterpart , might expect to expect sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a personnel officer who focuses on under@@ represented demographic groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; military leadership of IS@@ IS intelligence services , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states were allowed on site , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the Defence Force Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically exploited by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com units , regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are enough to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts looked at pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command &apos;s press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com affiliated publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ es could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force into life after being admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while continuing the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway due to the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence service published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the Supreme Council of the Committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday , by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokesman for the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ tique of the secret information about the Islamic State reminded of the wi@@ dening of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written article about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw a little occupying force in Iraq , and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of its excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
&quot; the United States win four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that American women won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , it knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first prize will take a little longer to the strong Dutch women who lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game on Saturday goes out , the Americans triggered a surprising f@@ uss through their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 places in the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey bat in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; says B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have the helm all around .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India was defeated without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and took the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and unavoid@@ able , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete . &quot;
&quot; you cannot turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names being sent to prime time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als , if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swim and may reign over it for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived the last 16 years that many of them , I had questioned , didn &apos;t know that there was an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
that could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a ground @-@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the car@@ essing trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two types of sports which essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the span@@ ish El Tramp@@ oline which means &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad , they are evaluated according to the execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to go to gold in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ thropo@@ ids and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes , according to the Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects to be a new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that ei@@ ghty prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shot .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response has been ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or early this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights authority now calls for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control over 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a battle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den that were forced to take advantage of turbul@@ ence over the past few years and could re@@ ar@@ ouse themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of slow@@ ing down below the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians admitted they were so gathered to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ per@@ as , which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ countries prosp@@ ered , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ per@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , who account for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; for 17 years , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethi@@ op@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethi@@ op@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ l@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ l@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar was in 2005 , after thousands of protests prot@@ ested , who were apparently pla@@ gu@@ ed by the government and stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ical city , conducted by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray will become more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests swept the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American administration used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp told Obama &apos;s asser@@ tion that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his campaign by attacking his repeatedly asser@@ ted asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his fel@@ lows , who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp made a rest on Thursday &apos;s asser@@ tion and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret , President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign on falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later said &quot; Of course , I said sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and to call back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an estimated tone , as his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while focusing increasingly on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent interc@@ essors , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements about whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control . &quot;
&quot; prior to election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being over@@ taken on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ologies as only a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once over the price of the market , café comes back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a shame cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years served good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
&quot; so@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced Ver@@ b in Summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous bet@@ tered it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ bler wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it &apos;s also a new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are nature trails .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also ou@@ sted by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and inevitably ordered the same . &quot;
&quot; I came fourth to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap shop took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies from Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ mark soup . &quot;
&quot; the menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ cians .
&quot; CO@@ Es Last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Bri@@ ck@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive @-@ pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inning .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; the teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; the Americans sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the paths with which the country moved to no longer be the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ules became stap@@ le foods that recy@@ cle c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way of eating food residue &quot; , &quot; Ziegel@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange blends have been tried out , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing grati@@ fication took preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , brick @-@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , contributed to the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ wives &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as such as creamy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies .
&quot; particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ dollar man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to write an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors created by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt did not mention that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of brick @-@ in @-@ law at the writing of the book - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man recalled , &quot; It made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the dessert recipe that President Roosev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a modest name . &quot;
&quot; there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone showed a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a post .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; Some hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved 60,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives at stake in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to help first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol of symbol@@ ism in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die of saving life , I think God sees me as a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four drums above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from lack of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie only got offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 metres wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , dominated by slow@@ ness , seems to be a god@@ father for a high age . &quot;
&quot; at any rate , Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected a long time ago , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie was st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
they measured their slow @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ons as they were sitting in front of S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transmitter .
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol in the bottom of the polar seas and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie which f@@ ishers between 2010 and 2013 were catching from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analysed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear dis@@ armament attempts to bring greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the l@@ enti@@ cular , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , so in 2012 it is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res should be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is not a coincidence .
&quot; even the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 @-@ year old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building site in a double pack
&quot; with topics relating to construction , the Municipal Council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee reli@@ ed on the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the development , par@@ cel@@ eration and closing issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for measurement could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , building will@@ s can be reported immediately in the Town Hall , and the Municipal Council is expected to advise the Municipal Council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also request requests to settle further business enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created space map in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of sub @-@ time lar@@ ds , the industrial area that has been designated there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; as a result , the City of Main has the best opportunities to move from London to reloc@@ ate jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK so far . &quot;
this is taking advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced that jobs reloc@@ ate .
&quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lobby association reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it also cuts down in infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city has easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city stands at Square 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot;
&quot; but London , despite Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;

a US @-@ based Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs you have created from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead stood after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was raised on Thursday , US officer Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a refund of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize Gilead that rules the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck cla@@ ve each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir ow@@ es land , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they regain complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j , near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokesman on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , according to the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting clean @-@ up operations , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clinton earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; candidate nomin@@ ee and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton delivered an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his promises to date . &quot;
&quot; it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Consult@@ ant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tru@@ mp critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations to charitable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to release his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico announced that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist from the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton is supporting a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor @-@ War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control test of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; of voters and not the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
&quot; Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an average tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that it was only $ 100 of her income as a reward , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main investment position was an inexpensive index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works support d@@ anc@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea to do so many years ago , has intensified their support along with the U.S. natural protection , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the International Day of Wel@@ fare dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps cover the light of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth , ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with a fire@@ works body is packed into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a thro@@ wer , who shoots a gold @-@ shaped fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election as Arab guests had requested according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; provoked his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel list list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel manager said that the measure was a &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason , which was behind it , arous@@ ed even more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet , where people called it a scandal . &quot;
&quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given to the alleged charges of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel situated on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; to not include Israel in the Quick Choice list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country pre @-@ selection has been added now .
police puts tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo and the police when they gathered to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police attacked Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters were seen gra@@ ffiti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests happened several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved of office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teheran in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , interest in Russian enterprises in the country increased strongly , and the ambassador negotiated with them . &quot;
Russian companies assume existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trading expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan anticip@@ ates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian foreign representatives spoke about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d which have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for : roof@@ ing beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ bery case has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the Be@@ e XXL drink market on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had surrounded their faces demanded the release of cash from the staff of the drink market and then fled at first by foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , therefore relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the attack , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel car park located opposite the park entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who made observations at the time of tat@@ too ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ bery , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical daily group / social group work of the Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holiday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet surroundings Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the joyful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and p@@ aus@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; culinary delight for children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ made desserts such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful pieces of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the regi@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ance trip to all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the Upper minist@@ erial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open doors of mercy on the Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and hal@@ o @-@ rooms were on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and distributed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a minster of Our Lady is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was started from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and lyrics . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely had to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , par@@ son@@ age groups of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and hearty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the next day , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of road , but at the same time , it had to be about 500 metres of altitude and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bath house in the evening .
&quot; after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , commented on the pilgrimage destination , were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold is competing for cycling
&quot; last evening , Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner was the glory of the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the pi@@ vot@@ al role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned into his own . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ alists .
&quot; they repeated the trick in March at the London Underground World Championships , despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the attend@@ ant Jamie Staff .
they did so in time for execution .
Gary &apos;s retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic race in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ der came in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der than they got on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an olymp@@ ic ch@@ ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 triumph at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ der gave notice that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the train . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s rivals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; it feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23rd March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Brown W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
yesterday he was argu@@ ing with representatives before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size .
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition that will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is relying on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were lowered . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing scenes as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks quite like the now legendary reputation of G@@ b , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land based on lifting energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ t@@ down of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company shared . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa complex in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt consumption consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting pot of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ts with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p keep smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt industry , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; &quot; that would have come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts already written in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt &quot; or to guarantee the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity each year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran onto Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , su@@ cked reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the universally beloved Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ nant ) : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é action almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an has started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the revelation of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years images of the Bulletin still le@@ aked out before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
&quot; Oscar prize winner and brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence in 2013 was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything fits Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers success does not like success . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again high when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the gri@@ m around , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she &apos;s in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centres annually assign 160@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary towers are rejected annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry faces the impact of further medium @-@ term implications for already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who do not have any means for un@@ just del@@ e@@ gies and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already fully util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of its federal funding . &quot;
the governor of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Market Centr@@ es found that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land congreg@@ ational centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with confusing and oppres@@ sive debts , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the general public prosec@@ utor and Federal Minister of Justice and Senator of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for leg@@ is@@ lators on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Campa@@ ign accused of allegedly pulling weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun to a staff , while on the way in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday at Charlotte &apos;s state court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have waited for months to regulate the matter internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the head of the campaign , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the barrel in Vincent &apos;s knees , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to suit damage , &quot; stated B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the prosecution came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate had triggered an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected . &quot;
it was clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence .
the complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
tru@@ mp press brief@@ er Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
try to contact Philip as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on behalf of his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has conducted a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses are marked for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could not go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .

the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot;
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite bul@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ aby@@ tes at the beginning , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover , as the &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to set up a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was accessible . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , though agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
&quot; no one could suspect in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft .
&quot; today , vendors are domin@@ ating vendors who all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is everyday for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , accounted for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
global sales of the equipment are around € 400 billion .
&quot; in addition , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies will be involved . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the night vision . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
Sa@@ gen now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , Managing Director of the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just like in 2012 in London when we worked out a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of broad@@ ening He@@ a@@ throw is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question you asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion at a fun growth and bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is backed up by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the addition of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to turn this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , companies that earn money with online advertising are the same as attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding with regard to its advertisements , to make it difficult to identify indicating that part of the page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle is underway between the time @-@ t@@ apped open source community and the people around since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook is soon coming to a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and inst@@ agra@@ m , the company shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; in order to have more control over the adver@@ tised advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ woman in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have rather concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in presum@@ ed suicide attempt on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday over@@ ride a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , asking them and every witness of the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases , where a person in the dark ran on the free@@ way , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed a man and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , absorbed the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- came to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was hab@@ itable once
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere , and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revers@@ al of Venus is exposed to almost two months &quot; time , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planet scientists .
&quot; although it was once inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy with@@ drew on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the club is immediately looking for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sa@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored as the best coach of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post @-@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to score five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the working struggles regarding the remuneration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the armed parties are preparing for a new round of talks to the table , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of stri@@ pping the present strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation based on the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes ever held in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in the star @-@ run to different rates , as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to planetary development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ run , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars throw large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , taking larger stars of slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ run of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year deal gave him 27 million US dollars a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach with a full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez returned with performance for a long time . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field was so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted to have forbidden stero@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called bio @-@ genesis scandal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect , for years to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot;
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 times . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot;
also his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage during their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was said to have sympath@@ ized with the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an experienced athlete had won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier @-@ runners in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the un@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday Ch@@ en had demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the talks about 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ Probe and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands a full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio the news le@@ aked out of the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athletes . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately expressed his criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing the start , also the runner @-@ nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming , the previous auctions in China also had cat@@ ered for violent confron@@ tations among the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ ass .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested by the Chinese nation@@ als in 2014 , but only a three @-@ month lock had to be replaced . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so Per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , some times the victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to the observation of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som will be significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Malaysi@@ an programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months . &quot;
&quot; ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ smith . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : does not pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay are receiving their data . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand for the perpetrators in view of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; the hack@@ ers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in an up @-@ to @-@ date study , the Safety Res@@ ear@@ chers of F @-@ Secure tested the user @-@ winning areas and contact with the black@@ jack and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming increasingly professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within one week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four people . &quot;
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ jack .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by buying the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ nie@@ wski says . &quot;
the black@@ jack then search for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of one criminals and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment will be paid per inf@@ ested computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ nie@@ wski comments . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known for many companies that better safeguard their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be prevented through file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful performance , the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price cal@@ endar@@ s , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the cul@@ pr@@ its could hen@@ ce@@ forth take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
security researchers demonstrated on the hack@@ ers conference Def@@ con as they could get an Internet linked thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators , instead of heating in the future , block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit surface falls off . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l in case of high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l in folded back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like Kin@@ os@@ dron and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; however , he should do his job somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; the equipment in the Top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because at the same time , he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
&quot; and the smart tem@@ p re@@ acts to the detection of traffic signs , and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required . &quot;
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , you will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standards .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of danger , which is typical of aviation . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ ec@@ ap during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of disease : when pays the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , holiday@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without a doubt . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
in the case of a family on the second day of their door we@@ dge was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the tourists back to a defective treatment plant , which pur@@ port@@ edly polluted sea@@ water . &quot;
the family felt that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information duties , so the verdict . &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; in July , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must react calm@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time on terror .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , this would increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Par@@ liam@@ entary elections .
&quot; he also announced further personnel reinforcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit range over several years . &quot; &quot;
campaig@@ ning for terrorism needs to be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right of weapons to be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens could be reduced , he said , looking at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister maintains a better social support . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD chief Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against shareholders .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the papers by the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ le from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality before .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is considered to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter accused the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages of action and action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet slo@@ gans and a sharpen@@ ing of the right of stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law shall be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jam , when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit of Wes@@ el Straße the right @-@ to @-@ bend lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is split up early , thus improving the entire process on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U fraction in the district of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road@@ way nar@@ rowing on the feeder gri@@ ps the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage extends up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before leaving Wes@@ el Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is guided just one lane across the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had resulted in the bridge not having the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related physical traffic jam will continue , the competent regional company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remainder service life up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it is expected to be charged with disabilities . &quot;
traffic is passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
the international classroom of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; Das Un@@ visible Haus . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; Das un@@ seen House &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s Association , 19 students visited the production in the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most youngsters of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from language school , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a line through the bill on Friday night - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will certainly see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which , with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour , belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is far before the wake @-@ up call no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems manifest themselves ?
&quot; there are several types of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Care . &quot;
&quot; but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is an in@@ som@@ nia and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely the sleep that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German household physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there are organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors behind it , but also medications . &quot;
&quot; not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; she says . &quot;
and it can be that various factors need each other .
&quot; for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc may be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to p@@ onder@@ ate over everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I get to the doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor .
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there are hardly any sleeping medi@@ ums in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should contact the family doctor first , advised We@@ eß . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for example in snor@@ ing with breathing apparatus , for example in snor@@ ing with breathing sta@@ ins , in case of illness or if you don &apos;t find the cause of sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cl@@ auses , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows the sleeping ends at the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws to place for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleep and recording times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not stop at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming has to do
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first took gold at the short track world champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time represented his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates who prot@@ ested in his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 Euros , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the pumping system in swimming sports is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to announce nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who has now operated an ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de arrested by baggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ Febru@@ ary@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els as ban@@ de .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 a.m. , civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport detected a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft crimes . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences in the mid @-@ July of this year and were involved in a collaborative , cooperative and especially professional approach . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the C@@ ID comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove to the thi@@ eves , who have been specially travelled to Germany for the protection of criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on the first glance , the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t work like that , but the police count them among the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , you get past play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; on the façade of a grey house , someone has spra@@ yed &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in recent weeks , however , with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the ca@@ det smi@@ ths , were evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners to open the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking pre@@ m late @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , is gener@@ v@@ t above all . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who is calling for a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police charge in a ver@@ itable street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from all over the world over the past few years : residents of GDR times and former hous@@ et@@ ers share their neighbourhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on inserted pan@@ es or freshly painted faç@@ ades that have been thrown into colour bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences , such as body injury , are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes make material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to violence , it is wei@@ ghty : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they don &apos;t have been that . &quot;
&quot; even the famous burning cars , there are no longer any longer in the R@@ ī@@ ga . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and receives more from one another than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; this is why it was so important for her to get back her road : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents , such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former construction holes , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; that is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so good in bed , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for the drawn @-@ out , who anno@@ yed her about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who prefers , should be aware of it - just like someone who goes into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ gee Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on the ground .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger administration .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is still involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; for example , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write down the site . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in social work , just an ice @-@ cutting wo@@ olen mil@@ let . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing this for about six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are great and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers will soon be available at Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the annex@@ ation .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the District Council Office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work , so be dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be emp@@ tied , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers will be placed in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ am@@ aged or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here , administration and volunteers are also jumping . &quot;
it is central for the refugees to feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases too , says customer honestly , &quot; people who don &apos;t have anything . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always motivated to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine says clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk may and may not be excluded . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ voc@@ ated .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary posts must be held on site and in the region after activities . &quot;
they have always in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; answering this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet , where we would like to , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been util@@ ised to fully integrate the previous people .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
chim@@ ney : looking for criminals with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house at 8.@@ 50@@ am on Friday morning .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward flight into the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded cartridges . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; on the ground , police deployed several squ@@ alls as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the punishment was without success .
&quot; perhaps the un@@ familiar ones were , in fact , close to the apartment or on their escape . &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police determined by Ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
