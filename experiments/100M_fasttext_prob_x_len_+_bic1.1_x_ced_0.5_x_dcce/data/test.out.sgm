<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a change on the beach with some colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career then ended again."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be guided by his family via the ALRV site. on a horse he did not even hover for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and so also with CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Pyramid of Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver leaf laurel leaf, champions tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British queen has already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are not involved in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate his death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive regulators massive, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would increase for the rich," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in which we must invest, Trump and Clinton are almost eloquent."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs into the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical apartheid wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining back to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly expand and demand renewables with their investment program:" "a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazid trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is necessary, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics regard him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"every one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and is dealing among other things with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the Munich North, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-born women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs has opened up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope-makers to Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they fall in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single-standing women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to an estimated 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich, traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they dare not speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations just for them, Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabians alone winged women are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors in some common shelters or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it reads:" it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, it can lead to - perpetually - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush, which there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the Registrasts have called upon their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers had abdicated to address the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" "persisted calmly" "would have had problems, which led to the agreement to be rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official re-negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council today to approve a running program of escalating work combat measures beginning in September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this year, the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck this year six times, the first overall outages in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the director of the BMA Assistance physicians, Dr. Johann Malavana, retired after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the meetings, which still took place before the vote by 54,000 Assistants and Medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Russia and Turkey: an" "alliance of outsiders" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles were slippery and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "dear friend" "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if it was never a bad thing."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was hot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara for months."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was released last month with a failed coup d'etat almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vejusti put it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious on the West, as its reaction to the attempted power takeover is regarded as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent grudge is coming across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which even has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray the" alliance of outsiders, "as an analyst once described as an analyst: two countries who feel bad and treated badly and are now fading."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents reported at the press conference that they didn't even understand the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided addressing a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in a statement by the Kremlin, it is that Putin had ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving reason."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been his substitute since 2012, became his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious International Relations Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it reads (in Russian) that he was later the protocol manager and chief executive of the government staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for leaving his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retired at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now - just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to trust in ridiculous posts for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin would have violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">"engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viadukt, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closings of the" "ceiling blower", "which approximates the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown reportedly paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a juggling for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the Viadukt is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team worked, they were tiny - they were just a few millimeters on each side."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building houses of Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken much more seriously in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "room for action" "for the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is," "said Bratmann:" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed, shall provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" "there is no agreement at the moment between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few precepts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to make even harder runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding that, as violas, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how to compensate for the loss of more around 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought outgoing bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be rethought to get apartments back to the price tag."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western city, deadlines are running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing estate companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the west town is increased drastically again, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"commenting on the situation, S & D Group president Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU has to go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"on the other hand, they have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness which is worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time running on screens, was complained by many during the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on TV, then video games and finally limited to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later this resulted in a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go out with their smartphones outside and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" "photographed" "(about a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the line and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that refuted the" average "person every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"cardio, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train every day 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" take 30 minutes "to" come from the sofa "and" be active every day, "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"those who regularly exercise sport, reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also gruelling players who have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="12">"American women Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the solo competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-battle title and the fifth, while consolidating her reputation, the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>

<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

<seg id="17">"it was expecting it to be a final examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between balance and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment."</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a series of victories that will last so long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even though Mustafina slightly led through two turns, the picture shook."</seg>

<seg id="28">"she again brought again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was another one on it."</seg>

<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the Bronzemedaille went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old Mannschaftscapitain, which is called" "Grandma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12 year old girl were shot who died in one of the deadliest assaults of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a drive, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="5">"Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, informed that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased."</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A floodwarp system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service showed that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will likely reach record levels over the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a flooding in Ascension Parish poses a threat, as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the River Tickfav, south of the Mississippi national border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded."</seg>

<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house, increased greatly over night."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water flowed and pouring in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years, where she lived there."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Globe, where they stayed until Friday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Krautmann said that the flood was spreading rapidly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities consider evacuation instructions."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil has been completely absorbed by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and a lesson in five school districts.</seg>

<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches that were now both flooded.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally echoes the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2."</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the tip of this sport, but not so do sports classes across the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the Last Five, because the next Olympic team will have only four female runners in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turner is a costly sport and is primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are located in wealthy suburbs to support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to inspire the communities of countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible sports training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my sports foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality Turns that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to care for the turns and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you for starting their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was released last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, accuses the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and communal government, now an answer king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off tapes outside of ballot cabins to protect frightened voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have a proof of themselves, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must simply name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes not to apply removeable ink to a person's finger when they give up their vote, in order to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to congregational documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the reigning Mayor Lutsk Rahman was to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racial and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman allegedly" "led" "his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person as someone else chooses."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"he expressed himself particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal election - with the older members of the Muslim community, having put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding outs to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"his report states that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been applied, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists process briefing documents to stop" "elections". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choices to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible for arbitration.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists process complete post-elections and envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set off shut-outs for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation facilitated by an accusation for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (VolksReprestung Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing prohibited in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English is allowed in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, to ensure that the employees usually assert that voters are entering the election cabin alone."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his substitute for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unfit," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "checkpoints" "of the electoral registration departments of the town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The Supreme Court in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"as the mother of parliaments, our country bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear," she went back and left the shop without buying anything. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "The people couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the position, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your robber around the skewer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then strike him with his knee in the body, and twist the weapon out of his hands, while the attacker is crooked before pain. strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and hit the Attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before it moves backwards and turn the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schows his tongue for a travel guide his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underdrew his immune system and Würreflex in a serious test - by detecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shaved his course on a euro note, a banister on Piccadilly Circus, a purging button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before dropping any object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to leak a toilet flush, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he had, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate curious as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to train stations to sinks of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely to a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their Luminometer rating was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes close to the worst thing I have heard in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted mad brainstorming so that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things where it was easier to make Ian, lick it and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty tricks on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocking employees found property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls laid bare holes, wooden boards were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had caused, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikers and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>

<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloiled her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Deloids were cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't bother anyone. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, where the police were convened at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added," "It is a shame that the lessee abuses to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family as a deloiling is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after delooning on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house management will now need rubbish rubbish mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014 police attacked a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash amounting to £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after owning itself to the owner of a class B drug in commercial foresight.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they are lesbians that do not comply with the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police shared that Delogierung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without reproach, as well as to those who were harmed by such a behaviour," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee was informed immediately to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary had told that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, found a urine sample at the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family had heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the Bollywood group in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from eastern London ascended to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not conform to and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany computes with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it might even be" "a few hundred thousand", "the chairman Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh advance of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with several hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already crossed Kurdish high-bursts before months, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the stained putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will start to re-start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">This will allow Erdogan to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or distributed over the past hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also a CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the head of the Union demanded that the Federal Government be" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers." ""</seg>

<seg id="20">"whoever does not suit himself and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum holders recognised in Germany because of political persecution."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer-election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot vote the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the parliament vote will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid to date it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election warriors, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and counting at the end of voices just grasping."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people over it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD is cut off and what remains at the end of coalitionalism.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as it did his legendary word-like predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"apart from that, Seeley has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel has the blame on the flowering of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy," "We create this" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if at the wrong time it is the right place for election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Angela Merkel is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other German states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a shame no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual voting conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"even the Union has noticed that on the land, the base is crumbling away so that it must be very strict, to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the expanse of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the counsel of the CDU campaign coke Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the S & D Group last saw 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the end of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the country day."</seg>
<seg id="32">"they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of vacation, and move largely to the Internet in their campaign campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign", "it calls the president Claudia Müller."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there is all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site was moved to the south at the beginning of the weekend, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the subject of the commencement of the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to setting up facilities for accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and the blocking of Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted, and so the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the town has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now ride from Ofandingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Credential traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," "says the vice-manager Florian King responsible for the vice-traffic management of the rehabilitation project."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were a lot of creeping paths and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were frantically involved.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality increased the measurement vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overrides," says King, who himself made himself the position himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 kilometers of kilometers in the speed 30 zone.</seg>

<seg id="20">"for the business people at the B 27, it is only a little consolation that the road again is open to customers from Rottenburg."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales breakthroughs, allows everyone to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some more and some are less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" "end customer", "i.e. for other companies, has hardly any consequences for the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" most slight decline, "but also admits that" running documents are missing. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants" hit hard. ""</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant profit otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"at all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>

<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his trunk-click returns to the end of the refurbishment work.</seg>

<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced: that a new security agency should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapons rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well.</seg>

<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything, which does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière.</seg>

<seg id="21">"refugees, who are purposefully caught in the country, should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts to a security check."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still undetected and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example, the question arises: what exactly does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the massacres of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that profoundly dealt with, were not clinging out in election times as well."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus.</seg>

<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high rise between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garristic dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the chiefs also call for a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="6">"despite the diesel, Europe's largest car manufacturer can further forward a plus thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the prior-year figure."</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Market leader Jürgen Stackmann pushed the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, a purchase restraint was given in some core markets due to" changed economic conditions. ""</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the USA, where the exhaust-gas grid first escalated, there is also a minus in beech."</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">"all in all, the predominantly concerned domestic brand of Lower Saxony is anyway further off lightly by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is beechoed."</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales leader Fred Kappler was able to advance sales up from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, worldwide 5,904 million."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen has been tampered with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, Volkswagen is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the course of the retrofitting, Volkswagen reaffirmed that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects."</seg>
<seg id="22">"following the retrofitting of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the car manufacturer has a" "guaranteed" "certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a" "guarantee" "as it was said on Friday in corporate travel."</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the" "Focus" "had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models."</seg>
<seg id="26">"last Monday, this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW had full capacity to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations thereof are not accepted," stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has assumed the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power, no deteriorations will take place after the retrofit and all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Volkswagen himself uses the term" "warranty" "but not as stated in corporate travel."</seg>
<seg id="32">"with the wide term" warranty "Volkswagen can see the possibility that customers, for example, come into a workshop for half a year after retrofitting - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in customer interest, too, it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandalous scandal may result in uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations, as stated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before committing to the comment section, to skip it under the pseudonym non-Alleenario men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild studded before I stand, hold my hands and say something better like:" "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three men middle-aged) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I guess was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pipe, people who heard about the comeback and are looking to buy their old plates again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers received an impetus from the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that awake happier rejoicing."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flutes from a sheet pile."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to it."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I leafed through a pile of bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of people: three men middle-aged) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came here and said," "I don't have record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead coupler to put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productless, less musicranked."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged teenagers."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts offers new synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz voiced out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but some psychic traumas are hard to find if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more like a window shopping than a big shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... it drives away with a dearest sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I'm giving the impression to sample the jeans pants pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are looking for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking of buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Plattenkunst."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumble through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would have a fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the provisional business and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the precipitation was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally run-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Friday, the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of refugees in the Dschungelellager rose to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcomers in the course of the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-year Rugby reached an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage here in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji shared a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-depleted and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Federal Minister of Economics, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition), said:"</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to this, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry was threatened by additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG conversion rate is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful endeavor of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "also in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "declared IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to intensify, as the world's largest producer of products, in view of the weakening domestic demand, threw masses of steel onto the world market."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has a little relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China rose."</seg>

<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"finally, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"at the same time, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"since Singen is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"due to regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, it explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs with older people wakes up a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-related people abreate to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, do not just focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one hears through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">"also, the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir."</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will improve and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - for 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound comes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone is singing from the acquaintance of a senior choir, you can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church officials directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, Austrian citizens are also still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, was first exploding two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchmen and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the end of the day, two explosives were set up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">Also Phuket reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the popular seaside resort of Patong.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing one city clerk."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower shop before the territory of the coastal police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang called on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks bear the same signature," said army general Danai Kritchard Friday morning in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it was too early to manifest itself as possible motives, but it was probably the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited territories and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the authorities would have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country over the last few days, but they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is standing behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police told their officials around the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will not be any necessary travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence also in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to instigate chaos, while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military junta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is able to benefit himself to restore the kingdom again to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not manage to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost one year ago in Bangkok in a stop at a popular Hindu shrine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, will change their direction and become extremist."</seg>

<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic crests or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance by Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starts."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but it was rather his not just sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media."</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old takes part in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen run in aedics, Habte wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "rouble of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English tabloid" "The Sun" "with" "Dad Bod" "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambi catered for media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a pre-run over 100 meters of freestyle alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim before Olympic for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvements are needed."</seg>

<seg id="7">The charges are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period may also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt explained the severe fees in charge of relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste water, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"thus, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect on the basis of the low distribution basis."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All misses come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of using the app black face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week gave some users a filter that gave them slot eyes, false teeth and inflated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>

<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was drawn into the turning extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older counterpart, might expect to expect sensitivity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that rapid-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collaborators, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel officer who focuses on underrepresented demographic groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual states were allowed on site, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Defence Force Committee, Secret Service Committees and the military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically exploited by high-level CentCom units, regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the CentCom are enough to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts looked at pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command's press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom affiliated publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossules could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called Task Force into life after being admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while continuing the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway due to the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence service published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the Supreme Council of the Committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "gave excessive space for deviating opinions." "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday, by" The Daily Beast. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon general inspector, who were taken up after complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the critique of the secret information about the Islamic State reminded of the widening of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written article about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw a little occupying force in Iraq, and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team around Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these temporary refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"CentCom's dam, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its excessive positive appraisal of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, it knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first prize will take a little longer to the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game on Saturday goes out, the Americans triggered a surprising fuss through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 places in the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey bat in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," says Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the helm all around.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was defeated without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and took the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and unavoidable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names being sent to prime time by sponsors and well-being TV commercials, if he was a swimmers, Turner or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swim and may reign over it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of them, I had questioned, didn't know that there was an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the caressing trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two types of sports which essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the spanish El Trampoline which means" "springboard". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiad, they are evaluated according to the execution, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists need to go to gold in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, upwards and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and the objectification of male athletes, according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects to be a new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that eighty protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunshot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response has been ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or early this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now calls for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control over 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a battle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden that were forced to take advantage of turbulence over the past few years and could rearouse themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of slowing down below the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted they were so gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amperas, which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-countries prospered, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amperas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who account for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"for 17 years, Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Haillariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Haillariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands of protests protested, who were apparently plagued by the government and stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amperical city, conducted by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray will become more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests swept the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American administration used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump told Obama's assertion that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his campaign by attacking his repeatedly asserted assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the" founders "of the Islamic State terrorist group."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellows, who try to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made a rest on Thursday's assertion and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism comes down on Mr. Trump while he has tried to draw the focus of his campaign on falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said" Of course, I said sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and to call back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump assumed an estimated tone, as his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while focusing increasingly on the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbiters, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"prior to election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being overtaken on each of his words."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apologies as only a further proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafe."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies from Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland watermark soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historicians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs Last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Brickman told her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house at the Lower East Side."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the crash crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive-pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered minced meat, this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat as many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the teams of women cooked for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the paths with which the country moved to no longer be the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casserules became staple foods that recycle casserolle as a" "wonderful way of eating food residue", "Ziegelman noticed that cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange blends have been tried out, as a low-calorie and nourishing gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchenware."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which includes recipes, brick-man prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943, contributed to the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "housewives" "and the challenge to transform pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-Cake food attitude."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie only got offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 metres wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, dominated by slowness, seems to be a godfather for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"at any rate, Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Grönlandhai, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist suspected a long time ago, Greenland's haie was stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's haie is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow-pentagons as they were sitting in front of Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt for sleeping animals or patrol in the bottom of the polar seas and look for cadavers, which torpedo from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-haie which fishers between 2010 and 2013 were catching from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 centimeter measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear disarmament attempts to bring greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lenticular, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, so in 2012 it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14-amounts in their lenticular nucleus, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres should be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's haie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live above all in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"as a result, the City of Main has the best opportunities to move from London to relocate jobs and companies in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The registrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="2">"last evening, Scotland's Callum Skinner was the glory of the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the pivotal role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had turned into his own."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medalists.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick in March at the London Underground World Championships, despite the resignation of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the attendant Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time for execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gary's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they remained, when they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinds, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner won an Olympic race in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hinder came in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder than they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old boy from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an olympic chord and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the 2012 triumph at the Kennys and Hoys page, Hinder gave notice that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the train."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"she said:" "it feels with all the UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kennys, it is possible to repeat Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23rd March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which will start today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Brown Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he was arguing with representatives before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the appropriate women's competition that will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing scenes as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary reputation of Gb, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of smelting of Portland based on lifting energy consumption</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium meltdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company shared."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa complex in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt consumption consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting pot of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melts with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt industry," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging business" "that would have come into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL income from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts already written in the amount of $187 million in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt "or to guarantee the power supply to the melt" is not impaired. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts each year and Tomago consume around 900 megawatts of electricity each year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it wouldn't be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this verse brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian's similar?), sucked reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the universally beloved Showbiz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacnant): they all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché action almost every birthday episode of a children's program (Seacnant brought the sentence," "You thought that we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashian has started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the Bulletin still leaked out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were clearly more "celebrities that modeled" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence in 2013 was on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - under the earlier category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything fits Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners success does not like success."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the mistlettes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were again high when the news came out with the show Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but on the grim around, it seems to pass by the point."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator came to market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good at hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite bulky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight Megabytes at the beginning, that would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, Communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover, as the" office in the west pocket format. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to set up a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was accessible."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, though agonizing slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">"no one could suspect in August 1996, that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era."</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, vendors are dominating vendors who all came much later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is everyday for a lot of people everyday."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"around 1.4 billion devices, on Samsung and Apple, accounted for 555 million units alone."</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales of the equipment are around €400 billion.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London when we worked out a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already provide 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of broadening Heathrow is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamend on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question you asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion at a fun growth and bequeathed a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed up by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the addition of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to turn this Olympian spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding with regard to its advertisements, to make it difficult to identify indicating that part of the page is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her-struggle is underway between the time-tapped open source community and the people around since the invention of display lockers, "and that Facebook is soon coming to a new solution."</seg>

<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere, and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow reversal of Venus is exposed to almost two months" time, "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in the star-run to different rates, as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to planetary development."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-run of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years away from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star-run, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, some times the victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observation of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom will be significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malaysian programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the blacksmith."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: does not pay, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay are receiving their data."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand for the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in an up-to-date study, the Safety Researchers of F-Secure tested the user-winning areas and contact with the blackjack and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming increasingly professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware roughly within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits have been created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is far before the wake-up call no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several types of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Care."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but the insomnia, therefore, is an insomnia and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is precisely the sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German household physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there are organic, psychic or behavioural factors behind it, but also medications."</seg>
<seg id="12">"not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common in case of depression," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a herniated disc may be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to ponderate over everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I get to the doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there are hardly any sleeping mediums in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should contact the family doctor first, advised Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example in snoring with breathing apparatus, for example in snoring with breathing stains, in case of illness or if you don't find the cause of sleep disturbance, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the clauses, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows the sleeping ends at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws to place for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleep and recording times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not stop at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"on the first glance, the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't work like that, but the police count them among the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, you get past playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a Bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on the façade of a grey house, someone has sprayed" ugly! ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy neighbourhood, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in recent weeks, however, with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as" No-Go Zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the cadet smiths, were evacuated with 300 police officers, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building workers were commissioned by the unknown homeowners to open the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers removed from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking prem late-i."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, is genervt above all."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who is calling for a majority of police protection against vandaliatory left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house-occupiers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police charge in a veritable street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world over the past few years: residents of GDR times and former houseters share their neighbourhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on inserted panes or freshly painted façades that have been thrown into colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences, such as body injury, are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes make material damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"when it comes to violence, it is weighty: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they don't have been that."</seg>
<seg id="28">"even the famous burning cars, there are no longer any longer in the Rīga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and receives more from one another than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"this is why it was so important for her to get back her road: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents, such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former construction holes, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"that is, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so good in bed," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the drawn-out, who annoyed her about color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been doing this for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are great and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available at Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the annexation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Council Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work, so be dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be emptied, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers will be placed in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be undamaged or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and the customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here, administration and volunteers are also jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central for the refugees to feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases too, says customer honestly," people who don't have anything. "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always motivated to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine says clearly, "what some may call naive." a residual risk may and may not be excluded. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the assassins were completely revocated.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary posts must be held on site and in the region after activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"answering this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet, where we would like to," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher have already been utilised to fully integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
