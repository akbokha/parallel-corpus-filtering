Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing policies in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu for a lack of will in the peace process .
the deal about the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by the Obama has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor tells his girlfriend to have shot . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb talked with a loud voice from the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that fell on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I just loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ gra@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous call at some point afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ises Lamb , also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb previously asked Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi out of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb was self @-@ confident with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb began in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he obtained his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and she was 20 , when they met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and live in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency room , Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
&quot; Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer @-@ fair market three years ago . &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings his own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of the Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; about 900 people participated in the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the University &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributing to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb had made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss known as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says it won &apos;t be as many Christmas @-@ season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . during the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees rose from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated gn@@ a@@ thing and an ar@@ mes@@ ial length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be featured on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief asks once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the General Assembly this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers , &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot;
&quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp &apos;s staying power and start to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
shri@@ mps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey from Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters are happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see the temperature of the tru@@ mp as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters on the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first electoral state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six out of ten independent say that his temp@@ er did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their schol@@ arly hats , Republi@@ can voters consider Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time of four out of ten at the end of July to put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , it is shown that a variety of GO@@ P voters can view Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ trust support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Caesar Fi@@ or@@ ina he has 14 points ahead , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their mind .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters support Tru@@ mp , say they have firmly forgiven their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign , called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , was the immigration turning point and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will deter decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and humili@@ ate the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it appears to be Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ by@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the Nord@@ se@@ watts .
&quot; in the street , a square meter house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros on average . &quot;
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special locations one square meter is the most cost . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top housing estates , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Immobilien @-@ Consulting Engel &amp; Völk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metres prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square metre , mind you . &quot;
&quot; but good , who can afford it ... &quot;
&quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top here as an exception . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two tw@@ ins in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a master@@ ful pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Milan Mission &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their inau@@ g@@ ural league in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers doubles pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starter success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race . &quot;
&quot; Müller was rewarded with his 28th hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of Olympic Debut Tor@@ wart Roberto , who suffered a shot of the World Champion as flan@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm scored hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium - and the Munich @-@ based words . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated image without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top class , including renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , who were defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks have been initiated too often via game shift to left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck right from the left when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; at first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Stur@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the poles of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put need@@ le@@ punch . &quot;
but at Tor@@ be@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er he was a for@@ eig@@ ner .
&quot; for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola ordered a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing the final training , &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the defeated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ler @-@ meter Müller added another . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly m@@ imed Bayern @-@ fans in her audience @-@ block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich tra@@ ilers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was transported from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : at ren@@ oun@@ cement , the risk sin@@ ks quickly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; the main causes of tooth loss include c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could last for more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ du@@ ke Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained H@@ einer Boeing by the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to a good dental health right up to the age . &quot;
&quot; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early loss of tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on lef@@ to@@ vers from late Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said the museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a specialist department for archaeological excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found something . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , which belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman of goods tra@@ cked
&quot; after a young woman is cri@@ p@@ pled at the train station , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police , she suffered severe injuries by capturing the train . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue personnel .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al track crossing of the young woman , there is no evidence of the mi@@ tig@@ ating civil servants . &quot;
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bak@@ eries , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;
&quot; critics concerning the cause of the accident can be given under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 , or any other police station under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station . &quot;
EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement with TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function is much more traditional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de is propos@@ ing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; TTIP should be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceeding clearly demonstrate that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the United States and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is scheduled for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against prejudi@@ ce .
&quot; until now , the parties agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , and there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the last months discussion , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment court according to its own data . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which is demanded above all by major corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel judicial system , which allows companies to ride damages le@@ ver@@ aging the tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiating national legislation or lowering consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act designated the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised in particular that they are not supposed to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the reform , the Commission considered essential points that the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association business Europe warned against limiting the economic possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; so far , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , where the timi@@ d working folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he talks about various places he repeatedly records on the map , which accounts for his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they originated and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has been a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; released in 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a v@@ ast@@ ly series : each of the 50 US states should be held in succession . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live meets his guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a widespread masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then serves on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; away from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and big fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and it is possible to throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , St@@ ev@@ ens makes a modest contribution to the en@@ core , plays a few older songs and ultimately bows to thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s questioning is anticipated with tension &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey and for the first time he will work with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after noon where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national an@@ them singing at a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t , says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; footsteps , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour is preparing to remove the whole idea of del@@ im@@ itation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions Minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy set , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from tac@@ kling serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said Angela Eagle that the Shadow Econom@@ ist will represent him if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy show &quot; , &quot; often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questioning . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first aired on television in 1990 , the Ques@@ tion with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower @-@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and expressed widespread reforms . &quot;

pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; in parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result had grown without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and most advanced assessments of the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has increased by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking @-@ over of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for Luxury Goo@@ ds Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
&quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again . &quot;
&quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of his strategy of reducing debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating to &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l states that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

Pe@@ gi@@ da @-@ poster brings Lebanese to the potato @-@ Greenland @-@ Ide@@ a
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the potato @-@ d@@ ön@@ er , developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster by the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wered with meat and potatoes has been spinning in its store . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the Lebanese have meanwhile registered the idea of the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Al@@ hay wishes not to disclose how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts Com@@ bat campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ dic@@ ation
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a regulatory campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defensive strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and equipment passes its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that after opening its first markets , Al@@ di will cut roughly five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash USD 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed costs base could cost about 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cal@@ a &apos;s revenue in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to publicly react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade that has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailer has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operating debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , rep@@ els and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to align selling prices with hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers by improving their stores by growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s premier managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs are going to grow at El@@ an , hoping that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell into the spotlight by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , leaving Har@@ rison : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to hit Kyr@@ gios and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f stained a potential US Open win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m pretty busy is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the fight , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket than he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Cy@@ rene during the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Cy@@ rene &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , with@@ draws refugees &quot;
Hungary declares the emergency stand and ri@@ gged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants caught up in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries , and built up tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian army police . &quot;
some expelled from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc with a meeting in Brussels unable to agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes in a bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency console launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country will also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after leaving a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprisonment races were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the point of entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs , government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament has yet to appro@@ ve the progress of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed in accordance with the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos converted the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to get involved , but thousands were outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a two @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground against her . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 % earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet whether he is running for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ ander achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has decreased mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders only comes back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic elec@@ tors under the age of 50 has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has , however , still a great advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the past month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections nation states that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them , because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are strongly mixed with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the di@@ lu@@ ci@@ bility are quoted as well .
&quot; as the Vice President holds a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the prim@@ aries , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; by Felix F. Sei@@ dler . Felix is a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheit@@ spolitik . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is higher than S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ des in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate , do demo@@ cra@@ cies call questions about elec@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in choosing the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot;
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ election generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister continue to be made , most of the demo@@ cra@@ cies of the pre@@ elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of Americans are now uns@@ atis@@ fied with their explanation , while only a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among the registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters throughout the country also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good notes on the leader@@ board . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but like Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tru@@ mp in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times .

but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ received by demographic groups and comm@@ itting Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten up with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most fallen , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the tru@@ mp faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;

&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood were bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , almost two years later , mur@@ ders against five persons were submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined of head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly warned an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members started to hide tools and basically set up the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly inflic@@ ted on the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs again with dum@@ my power . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies from the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grave for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment attacks and the formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also account for them , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rate of interest comes , and the hous@@ eholder is sha@@ ken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first increase in the interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising the interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal levels but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here , a look at historic trends is based on how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest rates may be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be sp@@ iced 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days after@@ ward ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , published by Bob Dol@@ l , Chief Executive strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to appear later in the increase in the increase and the return on return is beginning to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession . &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate raise of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , only nominal GDP was below 4.5 per cent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and pose the question as to whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants agreed all year to raise the F@@ ed interest rate , and all eyes were focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all ero@@ gation cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists are put into the shadow very quickly after the beginning of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the elevation cycle , the bond markets fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields closer and shorter between longer and shorter bonds and result in a down@@ turn in the curve .
&quot; high interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen , all the features of the market when the F@@ ed is tigh@@ tening its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and large companies , who handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet posted an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits from higher earnings , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ caster because of its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial rivals .
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; the European Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed in the Voice , saying that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP , Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial rivals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also focused on the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC CEO rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 would be far ahead of his commercial rivals when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn anything about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to perform new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder is needed to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial rivals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; member of the T@@ ory MP , Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased slow@@ ed in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed down the expenditure in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expendi@@ tures for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back until 2000 , that has always been developing over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started shopping with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event held last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers moved around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from doing shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion labels in the inside cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ tak@@ ers in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia disman@@ tling the collapse partly of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane crashed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mosque .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , widely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ cha Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; king Sal@@ man said today , the bin Laden group would not have let the arm of the crane stop when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a large mosque courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ ch took place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mosque as part of the massive construction project , which is managed by the bin Laden group . &quot;
&quot; the Ben Laden family has been connected with the Saudi @-@ Saudi royal family for decades , and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remained hospit@@ alized .
&quot; government officials stipul@@ ated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other criminals will receive half of this amount .

&quot; if you are skill@@ ful using a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain said that a major increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to professional tra@@ des@@ people and 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there still is a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to shift this stronger towards a balance .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group re@@ printed the cost of closing shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and off@@ ence .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he claims the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ence .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the committee chair , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence was a repro@@ ach to the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that an asset was not created at any time .
&quot; the sports officials had only charged expenses and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we continue the club or block us ? , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read professions large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
&quot; with his co @-@ defend@@ ant and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; with the association , it was agreed that you can freely manage the money , only debts can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of reimbur@@ sement damages had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid off only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , flat and not detailed accounts appeared , the former ob@@ servant explained the events . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us administr@@ ated the two defend@@ ants , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the association was not disclosed in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial community , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , the accused declared . &quot;
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
&quot; then he thought , he thought it was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why indem@@ ni@@ fication ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never had any harm . &quot;
&quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never obtained a cent salary , he merely calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; at Di@@ ets , he charged the Association € 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not instruc@@ t the defend@@ ants .
&quot; after an audit in which everything had been correctly judged , they were no longer kept , they explained . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second accused .
&quot; all the exercises were carried out in cash , and from his place of residence he had to drive to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard sp@@ ans 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff reduction that has been running for three years , the computer giant will be disman@@ tling further jobs during the spl@@ itting of the company . &quot;
the positions in the US computer terri@@ fic He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to cut down from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the 5@@ 5,000 jobs that have been running for three years have not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot;
&quot; on the fair , the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share delivered 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company from California , California , is split up with printers from California , Pal@@ o Alto , and is now to be bund@@ led together in a new company , separated from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ appointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would overwhel@@ m mainly to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves appro@@ v@@ ingly . &quot;
61 percent are positive that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , refuse to be 20 percent . &quot;

car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; at the heart of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; officially opens on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the organisers of the Auto @-@ Verband ( Verband der Auto @-@ Verband ) anticipate around 900@@ ,000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
the Hungarian police deployed refugees at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers for several hundred displaced persons .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and a water @-@ thro@@ wer stood behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially put an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have withdrawn somewhat now .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees sack@@ ed themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the Federal Reserve Bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate rose to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global proportions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; death cont@@ actor at the Delta State University , leaving exc@@ uses &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but will probably be upset . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb travelled 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded by him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night , Lamb rode his car aside , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ blue is on the university &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor was supposed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; 150 of the approximately 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to create a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and profit syner@@ gies , the airline shared with it on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer serve as a board member for passenger operations . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in future , the board team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ dt for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed following the strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , the cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the concept &quot; Wings &quot; is the background . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa has moved to the Group &apos;s own budget line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this made the left external defender to cry and won him out of the game for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w crashed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg score and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ teen .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad violation . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad violation , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , appeared . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a news on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it seems to always be a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything is beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead recre@@ ates an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y hopes to win the girl of his dreams , reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially reading like a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . here is an un@@ named boy , how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ ought stri@@ cken beings , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; b@@ umping into the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my ticket . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks section may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball evol@@ ves as a spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this news : Adam Ly@@ th retired from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not bring such good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick comp@@ ton received nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ re was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I treasure . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 votes against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of putting mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred ranks right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited relationship with him he was very impressed by me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup don@@ ors that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has taken some wise supplements to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain ad@@ mitt@@ ance if the economy becomes a flu@@ ke by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ prepared ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard on Tuesday for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on their own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a cau@@ tious lawyer , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ated long endurance as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why some such ministers may even deliberately not plan any helpful comments in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s reference campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of its value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one in 1975 but not that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opport@@ unists , who made a name as an &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ru@@ th@@ lessness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , hack@@ ed foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ nation@@ als who own most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ ap on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I look very friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ef@@ in material tendency and the wild followers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ ties when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and depu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stirring up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the reference campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try , in all , a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects the claim from p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to perform their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line from p@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; conf@@ ers &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these compounds or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes will serve as a way to qu@@ itting smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the re@@ acts of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are minor compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should abandon East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least apply its production to programs that others don &apos;t do or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme could be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give her right arm for that . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they are on their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast charge : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to verify its &quot; &quot; Rei@@ gn Mission &quot; , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be addressed to the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to let this change in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels alliances to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are heard with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , where ultrasound may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; th@@ read@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures , called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms . &quot;
sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to as a report Nature Communications .
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when an ultrasound is applied to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ bli@@ sters and transferred into the worms where they tune the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain by optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily halt the accumulated human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which prevailed around advertising for the arms trade - through a laying of the Ex@@ ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; by the blu@@ eb@@ bing with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of il@@ lic@@ it torture devices at the trade show , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ore , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let humans .
&quot; people often turn into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;

intro@@ ver@@ ted people receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ ram@@ bling @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos we kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something like that , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping dor@@ man@@ t when you knock . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are that they say they are serving themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , adding a dish@@ washing agent to their milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with an even more lau@@ ric music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , to get divor@@ ced and see her every day , and perhaps to see how she passes all together friends to her ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to give your under@@ body a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between an el@@ m and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which will put you in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions to the ceiling more than twice . &quot;

&quot; I show you can still build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner edi@@ ts to know how rapidly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced housing for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ al three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ ders : a town@@ house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ der : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; guil@@ der : legally , I have passed my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ represented , who manages three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; guil@@ ders : there were those , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; guil@@ ders : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the removal of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely through the sli@@ mming of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool , delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may be switched off half @-@ way and this could lead to an abor@@ tion of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows about the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton just a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup second emphasized before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the World Champion in front of the race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and double champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races in the season , taking the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
it is still unclear whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a dedicated chess and tennis player who held up for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross @-@ Service Cross 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which Chairman Alfred Klein .
&quot; thus , it is possible to include chess players who cannot afford the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search will also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his solidarity with the spa town .
neighborhood office looks for direct contact
&quot; under the man@@ tle of the social foundation , Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , elderly and couns@@ ell@@ ors receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or health care services . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital , as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; are also not in@@ frequently used because the comple@@ xi@@ ties of insurance companies are hardly understood . &quot;
&quot; apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di supplement themselves in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) underlined during the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the reconciliation of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the social foundation makes a major contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the neighborhood office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus gave an honorary member and &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as stated in the broadcast . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , 30 kilograms of muscle mass has been added in the past two years . &quot;

&quot; as a result , the grass ro@@ cked out of the shop , offen@@ ded the officials and threw down the fine fine @-@ penalty in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witness searches the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends r@@ ushed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim at first . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed there several times .
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a head@@ stock , one beat on the face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot;
the injured person had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; to date , only a v@@ ague exercise description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 m in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters in size and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police are asking witnesses and critics to contact the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ dol@@ l and Frank Müller ( left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dorf mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ low@@ ships met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ dol@@ l who are currently completing their training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also want to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I simply called her . &quot;
the Müller @-@ couple Müller liked the idea of practi@@ sing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so , one agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice . &quot;
meanwhile they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in the Di@@ ep@@ holz Group and volunte@@ ered to work in the DRC @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ er works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle as a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a talk room anymore .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 euros is granted by the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ son &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to the Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the north @-@ German average practice , there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor has been found , she would have also gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , whoever visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours also continues to look at familiar faces : he takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus reminis@@ ces . &quot;
she already feels a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds to her smile : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; said Minister @-@ Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright in parallel .
&quot; it is clear , however , that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that clear signals are needed , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , also not over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia has been denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances will also er@@ ect corri@@ dors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not look like this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to limit its limits to refugees but not to seal . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; according to the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id during the night hours on Tuesday to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it mainly concerns Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country will face about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which hitherto had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people ad@@ jour@@ ned certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were on the way all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was 500 kilometres away , through Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it could now come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route to a somewhat further west @-@ east@@ erly direction of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , which has already been predicted by observers . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; he did not call him details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently carried out a good report on the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
&quot; the Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local ophthal@@ mic note in Hor@@ gos : he is keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have belonged to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as business wire , marketing , and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der transactions should be made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars was launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders are ultimately captured , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the proceedings against 32 other defend@@ ants continued . &quot;
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted out both in the United States and Eastern Europe .

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by , as well as for questions and discussions , such as the volunteer staff . &quot;

&quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .

&quot; therefore , this public promotion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , however , is understandable , and ultimately it is a very personal matter . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex earnings mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share accounted for more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;

&quot; the lower level of view comes in spite of the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and , on the 4th of January , are effective and , despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ oming transport of heavy and large par@@ c@@ els , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO , Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid income &quot; considering weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday occupation were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;

&quot; in the last quarter , the turnover increased by 29 percent in the body transport segment , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras &apos; ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; facing them at an end of the two @-@ storey meeting hall , there is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time order from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive through the short @-@ term interest rate at short term , since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could wor@@ sen the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which uns@@ ett@@ les itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mil@@ der the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy perpet@@ u@@ ates the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest raising would so@@ ot@@ he financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ag@@ gra@@ vation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the rate expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , the Dow is now almost 10 % below the pole of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait for at least a month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the world economy &apos;s health is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in technical decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed is the world &apos;s F@@ ed . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere note of the Lei@@ ter Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ner , a vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest in interest , cited decision in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled the cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a bewil@@ dering number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and cro@@ ckery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;

&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shop@@ per makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has different take @-@ over options .
what it is here : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .

&quot; where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city centre , a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own car park , together with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Aid for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees come to Germany for these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach with her 74 conferences .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seekers &apos; home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole thing is different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande supports feeding for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet is actually affecting the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction request for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited Turn@@ h@@ ello Construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre is moving step by step : in the latest joint meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the committee had decided , among other things , an application for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was about the permission to form a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ otic first and roof@@ top &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is : &quot; this brings us to a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof ti@@ lt , which is to be prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction regarding the roof ti@@ lt does not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Municipal Council rules more restric@@ tive in liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , the Turn@@ h@@ room Construction is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ large hall will be presented to the District Council Office . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the Regional Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be employed . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further inside station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who was supposed to succeed him , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed defini@@ tively in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is now completed . &quot;
&quot; the Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , has ru@@ mo@@ urs about what the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ oll , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; this I close . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ storage sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ry are housed there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for tonight ( 8.@@ 15 PM ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal the clear favorite , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the guys at Bh@@ c took a hur@@ t@@ ful defeat and got something good there . &quot;
hunting boy with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in operation , as the police shared . &quot;
&quot; after a firing ceremony , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department ) identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crime
&quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and threw their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , fell victim to a violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; an active 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also considered to be active on Tuesday evening , who , according to the indication , was indic@@ ted and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen not as agreed at home .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing , a crime came up against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the detained alleged police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him tot@@ he charge . &quot;
the other investigations are to be carried out on the closer circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable pen@@ ises .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid homes .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also has significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany im@@ poses a housing deficit that will increase from year to year .
&quot; currently there are already some 77@@ ,000 housing units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in flat @-@ sharing rooms .
young adults were reluct@@ ant to stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud noise in the housing market .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , the tax income tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended for a limited time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W has already been well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 18@@ 4 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia address corridor
&quot; there is virtually no transit to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ state Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the destruction of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reported . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws which came into effect on the same day , in addition , practically obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not b@@ ypass border f@@ ences . &quot;
but the bor@@ der@@ line threat@@ ens other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 attacked people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the final decision on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the bor@@ der@@ line as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed on the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
convic@@ ted sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country are threatening .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; - almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically , however , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Hungarian terms , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left in the past few weeks at the road@@ side .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany . &quot;
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge ceremony on Sunday we occupied with the clearing house , when suddenly ten people were with travel agents at the entrance of the T@@ ent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly stopped the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Middle Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ hoped guest only once , with snack and drink . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers were switched from an ICE to a regional train to Passa@@ u in order to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try crossing the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a double brid@@ le run spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends several tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right away with the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancell@@ ery has publicly and publicly de@@ fied the Hungarian government &apos;s stance on the opposition of Naz@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad , looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant districts &quot;
Konrad has all hands full to do with the submission of refugees .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place arti@@ llery for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first headquarters of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ancy of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; master power &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Konrad is expecting a total of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial rulers .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator places great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are left empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must comply with a certain amount of towel holders or size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; should apply for a temporary period . &quot;
&quot; Konrad is based on his experience , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic any cost , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees by three to four .
&quot; until now , its own district search was not yet successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons concerned can currently be subordin@@ ated without these measures , &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
critic@@ isms of the city chief on the allocation of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) appointed further action on Monday in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; however , the protective persons would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , the fact that Austria now carries out checks on its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the industrial line in Linz is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - in which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; a total of 1.7 million euros was invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is desp@@ ised by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ er opened a second business in the Arctic
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : after all , she has now received an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ se wall@@ ets from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the great area Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who themselves have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has brought her mother into the cra@@ dle .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , can &apos;t answer the professional woman with last safety . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful bag of every outfit is utilized .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ emaker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether he expresses himself xen@@ opho@@ bic , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the election campaign . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ hair@@ style is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place is related over -@@ zig verti@@ ces related to it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they somehow find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; born K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to which besides Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the um@@ eration have , &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather im@@ migr@@ ated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican im@@ migrant workers in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter migrants from illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was born @-@ born Tru@@ mp who was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more dist@@ anced to the Americans , &quot; &quot; he is always so excited . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Pension Company Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined by Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , for &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who saw the Sa@@ y at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain@@ eering village .
&quot; from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1,@@ 800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park got the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no big shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the state capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a weekly series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage was not to play a role for Australian TV viewers because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the rating for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; until now , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes &apos; .
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers , beating slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe invented an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening from The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars a minute that failed to pass the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might unknow@@ ingly reveal who wins the bach@@ elor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who eventually lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you possibly acci@@ dentally gave an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood ad@@ heres his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have a ly@@ rical way of explaining why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become the game @-@ killing who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on 10 on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at its first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his desperate Cat@@ ch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ man Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian descent had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a po@@ orer start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin debut back then in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee figures , the free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn convention in Gross@@ gast@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get awards in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Elec@@ toral Council meets up until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as it gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to get to the causes , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed uniform standards for federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes others away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy in large wall@@ towns should not fall below the table . &quot;
a long @-@ standing favourite remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Ministry of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; medium level plus &quot; &quot; at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums , where an extension of the upper secondary school was tested from three to four years . &quot;
but that is not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W manager . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired gum@@ boots into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution would come into effect on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re @-@ built .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square metre area . &quot;
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den wants to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city . &quot;
which investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had yet been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located on the ring road / corner Great Street , bought already a few months ago and can be torn down on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday homes at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly announced plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ gli@@ ders are further worried - they fear the sell@@ out of their leisure activities
&quot; for months past closed doors had been negotiated , gri@@ pped , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday cottage at the Small Sea are close to Em@@ den at the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investor and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ ings went on the offensive from the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it was good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the ten @-@ to @-@ twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
&quot; violent reactions among mer@@ cen@@ ary owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the mer@@ cen@@ ary and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; moreover , like several other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the system : &quot; all the bus loads must come so that this can be balanced , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what exactly is happening on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable . &quot;
twin @-@ offspring at Gor@@ illas in the Frankfurter Zoo
the Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to have offspring with its gor@@ illas .
the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Di@@ an has yesterday brought tw@@ ins to the world .
twin @-@ bir@@ ths are rare in gor@@ illas .
&quot; the last one in a German zoo lies almost 50 years ago and was in Frankfurt in 1967 , it is called the zoo . &quot;
&quot; the sex of the new@@ born gor@@ illa @-@ tw@@ ins still does not stand firm , since mother Di@@ an keeps her close to her so far . &quot;
&quot; first , the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; had been reported . &quot;
N@@ HC is predic@@ ting 60 % chance for cycl@@ one south of the Cape Verde Islands
&quot; on Tuesday , the US National Hurri@@ cane Center predicted a wide low pressure system about 350 miles ( 5@@ 60 km ) south of the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most Cape Verde islands , which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical cycl@@ one in the next 48 hours . &quot;
another clearly defined low @-@ pressure system in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the small An@@ til@@ les has also a 60 % potential to form a tropical cycl@@ one in the next two days and added the weather experts station@@ ed in Miami .
Google launches double @-@ donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double @-@ raise fund raising 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation appeal on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled to Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / call@@ backs to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many flee from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity treatments for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same as 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely eliminated and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , compared to this , the diabetes was only about one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose levels , which reflected the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the guiding scientist Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are clu@@ es from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people undergoing obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is increasingly attracting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be set against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama pra@@ ises Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the September 11 terrorist attack and turned out that the US &apos;s violent response attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swallow hard alcohol dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years of age were reported to report from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them ends up in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children intentionally drow@@ ning dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young people can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol anywhere .
very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ hai@@ rav@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sy@@ ringe from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant san@@ i@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold prescribed by an adult as drunk , &quot; said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor who treated them outside Atlanta in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center . &quot;
N@@ hai@@ rav@@ jah had her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell due to alcohol and had pushed her head , &quot; &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities associates assume that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by extending anti@@ bacterial products all around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; the police regarded the en@@ ei@@ ving plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver travelled to the industrial area on the cross@@ roads and was too late that two passenger cars had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the accident involved vehicles Sach@@ sen@@ hausen was formed by about 10,000 euros , the police shares with them . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer safe and had to be tow@@ ed .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic descent

d@@ ons increase lead over Celtic to five points
&quot; Adam Ro@@ om@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers &apos; middle @-@ field @-@ player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show cli@@ ma@@ xes of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games and there are not only those people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef v@@ owed to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points of advantage . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly like that - but we must go on .
&quot; we really need Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
to stand together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers
&quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he shared some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entries and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; players who come in summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with privacy notice
&quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans . &quot;

&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ n@@ ast@@ le when it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;

Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to win against Hamilton .
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ tions to win a seventh consecutive league win giving them a lead of five points ahead Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won all , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases overall in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the U@@ K@@ s , as reported by the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime employment in Scotland decreased by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland accounted for 7@@ 4.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the process
&quot; as the security staff was unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police . &quot;
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 promis@@ cu@@ le and remained in custody . &quot;
why I Bec@@ ome Wit@@ ness of an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew nearer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as seats , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I have compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is incorrect .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after a ch@@ ase of police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house of peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
champi@@ onships football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria attempted to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
&quot; he focused on the ste@@ wards and the racing department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cobal@@ t test test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging bun@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted up , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name , when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy at Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ den , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the conclusion that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly way and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and off@@ end me , and I have no doubt that what I say is about to think about it now . &quot;
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainers &quot; frustr@@ ations levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching taught that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known through its preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like this last night .
it could have been like that yesterday all day that was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man is arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was hospit@@ alized with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries when he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , there was a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with driver &apos;s flight and failing help and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable condition . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against rivals due to alle@@ gations of ring fighting back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co @-@ Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly concealed remark about the Storm team after his team reached the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; prime example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ash of his crew and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; with the Tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , as it means they worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical about a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . &quot;
&quot; it is funny , as this occurs again and again at this time of the year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ dious team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of him . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher score than the game Bron@@ co versus cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points anything exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the pre @-@ final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ bier with 200,000 US $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who might be threatened with a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly life @-@ long sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , worried about the risk of escap@@ ing at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent statements of the two persons it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail under the conditions that he gives off his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian pas@@ sports , who registers every day with the police and holds an initial bul@@ let of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab pul@@ ls apart
a truck driver was seriously injured during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had stopped at a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to avoid left to the left in the last moment , as the police shared . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
&quot; the result was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone used by girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he fell asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of unnecessary images of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through and found the bewil@@ dering messages and immediately al@@ arms her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research &quot; , &quot; which used terms for searching for decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg reported to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; after his talks with the unknown person he was asked , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and tears . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having included in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before court at a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; in his off@@ ence is to be found . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael conf@@ esses the verdict of the judgment by October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
floo@@ d@@ lights turn on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up by the large @-@ scale control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest by humans in smaller cross @-@ border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , over 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were walking across bridges and traffic lights to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received by federal police and passed on to the registration . &quot;
&quot; according to German Federal Police reports , more refugees arrived at the Munich central station compared to the weekend of the week . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : excav@@ ator of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm o@@ cks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area in Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which in the past days was drawn from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic . &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , the compact cars are especially active in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( Audi@@ ence days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel offers a direct entry below the largest VW Golf competitor , starting at 17@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is available exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and accentu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan a@@ dep@@ t wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) . &quot;
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers placed their hand at the front part : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the raised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI were joined at the IAA in the compact class . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ ci@@ ary Pr@@ ater Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has made the Federal Constitutional Court decided in a decision published on Wednesday .
people affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a solitary cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now free on foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and transferred the case back to the trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a disgu@@ sting of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of the dent@@ ure damage .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; they spoke only in April to a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked . &quot;
&quot; according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , a human un@@ worthy decision is also the multiple occupation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had in@@ stituted a decent accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; over three months , the former plain@@ ti@@ ff lived between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , det@@ ain@@ ees are always included in 23 hours that increase aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to but@@ ch@@ eries , due to the ten@@ se situation they have already arrived . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior lack , 19 shall fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated resol@@ utely in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to mind in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built to date ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : from each year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and these exceptionally favorable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing units would have to develop annually , and the federal government would have to invest USD 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and Federal Minister of Engineering agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; by Felix F. Sei@@ dler . Felix is a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheit@@ spolitik . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , Germany has given a political change in Germany : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while formerly a ban on asylum seekers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the mandatory obligation to restrict asylum seekers to a residential area . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled personnel , the view is enforced so that refugees should be able to access the labour market sooner . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the development of networks is the King &apos;s Way to work integration according to the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees spend their children in kit@@ es , estimated ten to fifteen percent : &quot; it is only once very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sta@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increases strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the education capacity - for instance by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state requires asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ er@@ willing Refu@@ ge@@ es could be facilit@@ ated to access the university . &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not get any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start a study .
&quot; the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this gap can be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also this gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should receive b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state law to develop a new state @-@ religion ratio . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wohl@@ fahrts@@ verband , which is professionally taken care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
the rights are also duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said at Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic of society as a whole . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law for a decade now . &quot;
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants and stakeholders of non @-@ white German demand for a long time and why international agreements , such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany , must become reality in the coming years , if the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees that have so far been expected , writes medical officer Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to susp@@ end health cards immediately . &quot;
services rendered may later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the restricted service catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers especially . &quot;
&quot; so far , so the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are ill @-@ informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices , interpreting costs would have to be adopted . &quot;
many refugees have been helped but also with more general medical start @-@ up centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , in refugee children there are clearly more untreated abilities , and with the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other forms of disease , German doctors come from her education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors , may possibly even allevi@@ ate allevi@@ ation by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some of them were even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly further ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ k . &quot;
a recent study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child will be traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , severe timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , usually cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick @-@ wre@@ ath to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage staging . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to the audience lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to get away from everyday life and take it into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the nearly 3,000 @-@ kilometre tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the Circus Festival impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to easily record the Cuban duo . &quot;
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous sal@@ mons , the circus ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated by intuition and jo@@ in@@ iness . &quot;
balance with the one @-@ wheel on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an there is no problem .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
sixty employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at her : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , something is likely to be there . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or a hundred viewers , we always do our best and with all our heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites from 17 to 20 September , every day at 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; on Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe Perman@@ ent Spe@@ ech in the Parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with repentance . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had taken him out and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reductions will lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today , and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league players in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have experienced most of the injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a difficult time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Chelsea Olympics on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to break a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal is clear favor@@ ites to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 matches , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven away from the far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked out yet .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the comedy show which gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , how self @-@ mor@@ rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 marks the year of the man to question the culture that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritually healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication with social media , focusing on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telep@@ hon@@ y pastoral ministry said to me , &quot; &quot; My responsibility for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened with suicide is really clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop totally re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion up , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Don@@ et@@ sk Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only seek to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but to improve on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ ho@@ el of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , who was able to hold a 2 : 2 deci@@ de@@ dly in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ stor@@ mer was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished in the long corner of the grid at Johan Wil@@ and . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , which struck Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , played at An@@ no@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps Post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who died only in the first half with no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the Pill@@ ar ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour &apos;s stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an thus achieved his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent gra@@ bbing of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot;
qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core accum@@ ulates $ 2.5 billion by share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is located in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion $ by buying stock sales as part of its huge debt plan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a disa@@ strous effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange at the early Wednesday morning trading .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week &apos;s $ 2.5 billion stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

&quot; Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping won a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before going to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi should address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern 2008
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner League winner , four times champion league winner , two times European champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i tells us that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the beginning of the European Championship in 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that he has made me feel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , folded the red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she will not need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the movie and not at the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian bound themselves . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck producers and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a fil@@ thy beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said , that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et comp@@ eted more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social debate .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national effect and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to put discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured sti@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; in February , Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still weaker , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , the leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who were invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional athlete and operator instruction Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which closed its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the ti@@ ring phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge every three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the big prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac e ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac could have felt the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting starts in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the final square in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins wa@@ ved a chance to climb within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all the victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kis@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hits 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and so I really want to go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has done well with the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( kick training ) , saw clearly better off in the bull@@ pen , and he put it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three ranks at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon took his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran a wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left a two @-@ run escape from Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen provided the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League , 27 times this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was hitting a double play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inning , Berlin made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed player stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit became the pr@@ elu@@ de to the game of an un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ ked gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he has caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever Right @-@ handed A. J. A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , three ranks came with six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the litter .
he is being studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder break , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is stri@@ cken from the list of injuries to fight against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing since August 20 because of a strain on the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived there will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden arran@@ ges on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen state capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there . &quot;
they will then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse arrived for the first recording of the Fo@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gi@@ essen , responsible for the first @-@ time recording . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria have an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; collective looking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the cup had passed by military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is crashing down on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international humanitarian aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
your destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann together with several other EU heads of state and government filed a special summit next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial reception and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ scored , those people who needed shelter mo@@ urn this too . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
&quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania collap@@ sed with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from sc@@ rolling over Romania - Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; beneath the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us ice cap , a global ocean is sp@@ ying . &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon simply stag@@ gers around the ring @-@ plan@@ ets on its path . &quot;
&quot; although this movement is only small but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a Communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ mond in 2006 , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama lacks 1860 München several weeks
&quot; the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama , an offen@@ ding actor for about a month . &quot;
&quot; an investigation has yiel@@ ded an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association . &quot;
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis means &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a grave loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper overlooking the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was also contracted by the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has the possibility of proving his skill . &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can again return to team training after his conc@@ ussion . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured herself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h on the head .
&quot; however , contrary to the first concerns , he remained without a serious blu@@ es@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins are contained as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel @-@ color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consume within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS again places up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
above all drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , late deliveries had brought the parcel services harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ eh@@ n@@ storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine ord@@ inal side of the F@@ öhn winds through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz r@@ ushed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and the night of Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows some with storm @-@ strength through the thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , on Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate until the adjacent medi@@ a@@ and , and even or@@ cs of more than 120 km / h can be found on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , blow @-@ dryer ensures mid@@ summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the moisture on the Alpine slope begins to du@@ st@@ ow . &quot;
here &apos;s the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , the south of the Alps needs to be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , after large rainf@@ alls have already fallen in recent days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow dri@@ fts out the air , resulting in a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind is refreshing to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures are falling significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther site in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Lutheran churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in sec@@ rec@@ y over centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic manner , the place symbol@@ ises that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
&quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) , as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 . &quot;
he felt the city then as a rotten sin @-@ ba@@ bel .
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold ) crown crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has survived the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite som@@ bre . &quot;
&quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt collabor@@ ated on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross way , pla@@ gues , commandments or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the biblical passages chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ tes painting .
&quot; embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot;
&quot; there was education already with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ work that , in order to carry me back to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to restore art to more promin@@ ence in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed manner : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is characterised today by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to fall into the pictures , letting them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation : &quot; &quot; I like to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to the fact that the Bible was completely compreh@@ ended , but also the most important , mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a picture @-@ bi@@ ble was created . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 . &quot;
beginning of construction for BM@@ X rail is approaching
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X , it was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration caused dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who refused to tolerate the course . &quot;
&quot; so hill slo@@ ped , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck can now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; memorial break &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga adds a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; the football team re@@ acts to the situation in Germany , and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in getting a grip on this topic , &quot; said the DF@@ B manager Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could help and want to help .
&quot; the decisive course , however , must be policy . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; explains Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal government officials also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign if they will support the &quot; Wir - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsorship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama passes everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use our jet power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a big community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own places is great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have issued , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this year and next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses sight of an accident
&quot; according to several reports , the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then pulled out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it &apos;s important to stand up again when you fall down .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ eted a photo and explained that he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; therefore , at the weekend in Singapore , he is as little as a reserve vehicle for the two regular drivers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Turn@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we can unfortunately not fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ kel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his head eleven at the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
&quot; this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of &quot; &quot; Stamm@@ ler Roman bür@@ ki &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; although Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also compete in the second game . &quot;
&quot; fellow player R@@ eus said that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl believes : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of cars . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ atic Show of a &quot; new mobility @-@ age . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who will also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rise to digital radio communications . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks being br@@ ushed up &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; review the legal fra@@ me@@ works &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per kilometer . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 can be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors estimate the study by 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German auto @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across the streets . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , the traffic in flowing traffic could still imagine 15 percent , in traffic 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double @-@ start at table tennis
&quot; according to present status , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only be able to beat in singles from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite now , &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also recalled the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo has also been missing and we became European Champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; declared the Fi@@ fth @-@ Fi@@ fth . &quot;
the British football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the Defender has been hit by a tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figures greeting cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look frigh@@ ten@@ ingly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just fine clothes , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely still @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not structured chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort has been done : to fr@@ inge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich for 14 tonnes of material . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , successive fashion attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later contributed to designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs from other designers such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later on I bought it of course .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , who used them for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work any more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the fashion sheds P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
fashion played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® and was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use any niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of our orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ itor P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade , there are almost no more . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass production is much cheaper nowadays in Asia , and is sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , currently under Russia and in the US . &quot;
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association seeks to score points in terms of environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from nitrogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of West Saxony Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine stops small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took an inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze : young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
thus I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es for a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic girl girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI aims to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy needs to open broad out@@ wards in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group which was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created , identified by sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and open the market more openly , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the Statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and simpli@@ fying the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their work , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to depri@@ ve consumers of a significantly higher dose of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big predat@@ ors are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that at the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches can not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; according to Food@@ watch , the EU plans to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in exchange for this attrac@@ tiveness . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch described it as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low loaded , that they already observe the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly po@@ ison@@ ous for humans . it is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system , especially in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declares at its homepage with regard to the highest levels in force , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations issued more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
