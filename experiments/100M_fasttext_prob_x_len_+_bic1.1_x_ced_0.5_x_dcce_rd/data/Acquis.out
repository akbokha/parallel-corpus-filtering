&quot; considering that it is necessary to make additional measures with regard to a smooth functioning of this agreement , &quot;
&quot; given the regulation of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of Swiss name for watches , &quot;
&quot; in view of the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland , in the field of watch@@ making , &quot;

&quot; the raw materials produced in the Community , which are listed under the agreement included in the agreement , as well as the regulating components manufactured in the Community , are considered equivalent to equivalent quality such as raw materials and individual parts of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical features . &quot;
watches and movements composed of these units and components must meet the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland .
2 . the list of raw materials produced in Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 will be revised periodic@@ ally according to the following mod@@ alities :
a ) The application for the inclusion of new shell cali@@ bres in the list is directed by the associations of the watch industry of the community or by the producers based producers of raw materials to the Swiss C@@ lock chamber . the application is accompanied by a technical description of the shell cali@@ ber .
the Swiss watch chamber is carrying this or the new cali@@ ber in the so @-@ called list immediately .
&quot; if the inclusion in the list for a shell cali@@ ber has already been applied , which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the legal technical control in Switzerland , the Swiss movement chamber can reject the recording . &quot;
B ) The collection of raw materials listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watch@@ making industry of the community or by the producer who had previously applied for admission to the Swiss Chamber of Watch .

&quot; if this does not agree , it may take the procedure pursuant to paragraph 3 within two months . &quot;
&quot; D ) Every request to change the list according to the letters a ) , b ) and c ) will be immediately displayed to the selected Committee of the Swiss C@@ lock . &quot;
&quot; 3 . in the event of the quality of the quality of the agreement , the Commission issued in Article 9 of the Treaty of 30 June 1967 shall immediately be dealt with the matter by the parties concerned . &quot;
&quot; the first acting party seeks out from itself the Institute for the official quality control in the Swiss watch@@ making industry , as well as an appropriate institute of the community designated by the respective party of the community in order to give a common opinion . &quot;
&quot; in view of this report , the institutes constantly monitor from a Swiss company and from a company of the community each a batch of watches or movements that are sufficiently representative , and basically no more than 50 watches or movements . &quot;
&quot; after checking these games according to the norms of legislative technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their findings and create a joint report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with its conclusions and with its possible proposals . &quot;
the agreement and the list attached to it will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watch@@ makers by the relevant professional associations .
&quot; at least every three years , calculated from the entry into force of the agreement , the Mi@@ xed Commission is taking a re@@ design of the list to take account of the entries and matches that have been made . &quot;
&quot; the agreement enters into force on 1 January 1973 , unless the rati@@ fication certificates have been exchanged at this time . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the exchange of rati@@ fication documents will take place between 1 January and 30 November 1973 , the agreement will enter into force on the first day of the second on the exchange of the following month . &quot;

&quot; ( 1 ) Every contracting party reserves the right to refuse the approval of road vehicles or containers , which do not comply with the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 . &quot;
&quot; the contracting parties will , however , avoid a delay in transport if the identified defici@@ encies are of little importance and no risk of smu@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) road vehicles or containers , which no longer comply with the conditions that apply to their approval , may only be used again for goods transport under customs clearance , if their original condition is restored or the vehicle respectively the vessel has been re @-@ approved . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) There is no special customs document required for the temporary import of road vehicles , trucks or containers used for transport of goods in the TI@@ R process . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 does not hin@@ der a contracting party to demand that the identification agency assumes the form@@ alities envis@@ aged by the state law to ensure that after completion of the TI@@ R transport , the road vehicle , the truck or container is re @-@ executed . &quot;
&quot; road vehicles or trucks carrying a TI@@ R transport must be in front and rear a right @-@ k@@ ly , the characteristics of the system 5 corresponding table with the inscription &quot; &quot; TI@@ R &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these panels must be so appropriate that they are well visible ; they must be det@@ achable .
( 1 ) A separate Car@@ net TI@@ R is required for each truck or container .
&quot; a single Car@@ net can , however , be manufactured for a load suit or for several containers loaded onto a single road vehicle or a truck . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the contents of each vehicle or container belonging to a truck must be specified separately in the Car@@ net TI@@ R &apos;s manifest . &quot;
&quot; there must be at least as many separ@@ able assumptions - and un@@ just cuts , as required for the transport in question . &quot;

B ) must be located in no more than two different countries ;
&quot; the goods and the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container are to be presented with the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; the customs authorities in the initial country meet the necessary measures to convince themselves of the correctness of the content of the goods and to inspect the customs connections , or to check the customs agreements created under the responsibility of these authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities can set a deadline for the journey through their country and demand that the road vehicle , the truck or the container hold a prescribed route . &quot;
&quot; the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container are to be brought to control with the goods loading and the associated Car@@ net TI@@ R of any passage of passage and the identification points . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The customs authorities of each contracting party generally accept the un@@ finished customs agreements imposed by the customs authorities of the other parties , except that a copy of the goods is made in accordance with Article 5 paragraph 2 . &quot;
&quot; however , customs authorities can also create their own customs agreements if this is required for control . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The customs closures , recognised by a contracting party , enjoy the same legal protection as the national customs closures in their field . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities must be accompanied only in exceptional cases - road vehicles , trucks or containers in their country at the expense of the transport company , &quot;
&quot; - on the road for inspection and inspection of the goods loading of road vehicles , trucks or containers . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities take notice of the loading of a road vehicle , a truck or a container in a transit point or on the road , so they must remember the new customs connections and the type of checks carried out in the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections . &quot;
&quot; if customs closures are bre@@ ached in other than the cases referred to in Articles 24 and 35 , or are damaged or damaged without any breach of customs duties , the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 will be included and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R will remain un@@ affected . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) If a transport with Car@@ net TI@@ R is touched on a section of the territory of a state that is not the contracting party of this agreement , the TI@@ R transport will be suspended during transit through this area . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the customs authorities of the contracting party , through which the goods are transported , recognise the Car@@ net TI@@ R , if the customs closures and / or the proximity signs remain intact . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R in the area of a contracting party does not use the Car@@ net , because easier procedures for customs duties are offered or the use of such a procedure is not required . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In such cases , the customs offices where the TI@@ R is suspended or re @-@ recorded shall be deemed to be a gateway at the exit or the entrance fee at the entrance . &quot;
&quot; subject to the provisions of this Convention , in particular Article 18 , the intended destination of identification can be replaced by another destination agency . &quot;
&quot; upon arrival of the cargo at the destination agency , the Car@@ net TI@@ R is to be carried out incor@@ rectly , provided the goods are supplied to a different customs procedure or used for free transport . &quot;

the used Car@@ net TI@@ R must bear the emphasis on &quot; exceptional heavy or bul@@ ky goods &quot; on the envelope and on all sections in English or French .
&quot; the customs office may require charging stations , photographs , plans etc . , which are necessary for securing the goods transported , to the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it se@@ ws these papers with its stamp , stit@@ ches a copy on the back of the Car@@ net TI@@ R circular sheet and notes it in all its mani@@ folds . &quot;
the customs offices of each contracting party recognise the customs connections attached by the competent authorities of the other contracting parties and / or proximity signs .
&quot; however , you can also add customs connections and / or proximity signs , but have to remember the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections used in your country , on the respective ancest@@ ry sheets and on the sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , the newly attached customs connections and / or proximity signs . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities must remove customs closures or remove proximity signs with a customs clearance procedure or on the go because of a sh@@ rou@@ d of the cargo discharge , so they mem@@ ori@@ ze the customs duties and / or proximity signs used in the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections . &quot;
&quot; those who violate the provisions of this Convention shall be liable in accordance with the laws of the country , in which the infrin@@ gement has been committed . &quot;

1 . the contractual parties do not take into account slight deviations in the provision of obligations connected with the deadline and duration of the journey .
&quot; the customs administr@@ ations of the exit - and destination country , where applicable , wai@@ ve any deviations from the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R holder if these deviations affect customs procedures that have taken place before or after the TI@@ R transport and where the owner of the Car@@ net was not involved . &quot;
&quot; a satisfactory proof has been provided by the Custom@@ s Auth@@ orities that the goods listed in the merchandise manifest of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have been subjected to accident or higher force or that they are absent due to their nature through natural sw@@ ings , so exemp@@ tion from the usual wi@@ ese to substantial duties and duties is granted . &quot;
&quot; upon established application of a contracting party , the competent authorities of the contracting parties , which are affected by a TI@@ R transport , provide all available information for the use of articles 39 , 40 and 41 . &quot;
the explanations in Anne@@ x 6 and Anne@@ x 7 Part III contain provisions of some provisions of this agreement and its facilities .
&quot; any contracting party grants the parties involved in relief for the transfer of the necessary means of payment ( a ) to the payment of the amounts required by the authorities of the contracting parties due to Article 8 , and &quot;

( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) are as low as possible for the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each state is opposed to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of this Convention , the relevant provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are terminated with respect to core material , if the community and the organization realize that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of securing measures of exposure , or virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to the Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention will be terminated with respect to the core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , will assume responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization produces documents , from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community shall agree to the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures under this agreement can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core explosive .
B ) The organization and the community meet a regulation that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are not applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures provided in this agreement will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is kept on the ongoing basis of the total amount and composition of the material contained in the respective state or the concerned states and on any transfer of such material from this state or states .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include approval or sec@@ rec@@ y of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , States or individuals who are subject to their territorial authority , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special search of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it has beforehand agreed . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which is demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , shall be entitled to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this agreement in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the community or the organization due to damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , which resulted from the implementation of the securing measures under this agreement , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council , after checking the fac@@ tual information submitted by the General Manager , determines that the organization must not be able to verify the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II paragraph C . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been acquired by the security measures applied , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the parties involved is affected - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or the state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged with the exception of any disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this agreement and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another of the organisation , the Community and the States , on the request of a party to submit to an arbit@@ ration tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ren@@ ame two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also ren@@ ames two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth that will pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbitr@@ ator , the community or organization may seek the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days following the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the concerned states . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community , in force , i ) if the State of the Organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the organization of the organisation is notified that it is able to apply its securing measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states seek to consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties regarding a change of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The general led@@ ger immediately instruc@@ ts all member states of the organization from any change in the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organisation of the Community and States receives written notification , that their procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention remains in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this section of the Convention is to determine the procedures required for the implementation of the provisions of the Part I , as required . &quot;
&quot; the objective of the safegu@@ ards established in this agreement is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such a branch through the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial integration and monitoring as important complementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of accuracy is not specified for each material balance sheet , stating the accuracy limits for the specified seas . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their audit , the organisation makes full use of the security system of the community in accordance with Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures of the following kind of use will make use of them and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the continu@@ ance of the core material and the inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; ( C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ; &quot;
e ) procedures to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured inventory and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which displays the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance sheet for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance sheet ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organisation in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention do not cover material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) If ur@@ anium or th@@ orium containing material has not yet been reached into the states described under the letter c ) , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , leaves the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or will this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not permitted or desirable , the organisation and the community should consult each other on the application of suitable safegu@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are am@@ ic@@ able that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation exemp@@ li@@ fies nuclear material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this agreement , provided that the entire material quantity liberated in the States is no longer at any time more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ( II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculating its weight with the five @-@ fold quad@@ rat of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; the released core material , together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this agreement , shall be processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organization supplementary agreements , which in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organisation under this agreement , determine how the procedures established in the Convention shall apply . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organisation , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization establishes a consolidated inventory of the entire nuclear material underlying the securing measures of this Convention , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory due to the following reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general subsi@@ dy problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) The objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months after the agreement is entered into force , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which includes the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the Organization as administrator tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ically and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is guided separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes issued by the member state , which are to be paid in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the administrative office of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment shall be made in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the deadlines stipul@@ ated for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans . &quot;
&quot; C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments before the aforementioned dates . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the school jun@@ ctions in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further bor@@ rowing capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ credi@@ ting ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries are governed by contributions from other sources .
&quot; every transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered , approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices financed by the organization &apos;s ordinary means of organization ( including letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ord@@ al funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; they are therefore re@@ payable in the case of ten free @-@ years in each case . &quot;
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization they retain .
&quot; each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or used ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and those in accordance with what the car@@ et@@ aker has set at the time of loan granted , recipients of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital withdraw@@ als of special transactions take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until the full allocation of all special transactions , the supervis@@ or has instructed the E@@ EC concerning the projects and programs approved by the directors through the projects and programs approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator has informed the E@@ EC quar@@ terly about the development of the special transactions and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the Administrator transm@@ its an extensive billing of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the manager of the E@@ EC transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction , the amounts paid out of the accounts recei@@ vable and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organisation could possibly agree , have not entered into force , so the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are invalid . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital required by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is ref@@ unded and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have noted the termination of the procedures in question to the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and takes effect on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch languages , with each wording equal to the same . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter exchange for the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of the Protocol 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T follows : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a joint venture under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty ( herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to reduce their respective efforts to speed up unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research activities that have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable any contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by combining their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and accordingly the common goal of this research , i.e. , to achieve the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contractual parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be expanded or modified after testing through articles 5 to 10 and article 16 of the present agreement that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contractual parties adopt a new program , this will take place in the section of the program listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised by : - reasonable participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the concerned laboratories in the Eur@@ atom States , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those placed between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agre@@ ements on Human Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint venture J@@ ET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned with ensuring that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract , whose objective is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar agreements concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , envis@@ ages the establishment of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of the research work , and to steer so that the best possible results can be achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; at the most two delegates , Switzerland is represented in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has the information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , takes on this task in terms of all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes co @-@ operation and coordination between the associates and in the interests of the two parties involved in the common objective established in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common objective established in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into consideration the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advis@@ ers created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek . &quot;
&quot; the advis@@ ors of the VG research proposals , with a view to the fact that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom Program provide the best possible scientific results , take on this task in terms of all research and development work to which it is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for the optimal use of the capacity of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , will provide this task with respect to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which have adequate proposals for the best use of the resources , personnel and the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take this task in the respective field with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of future programmes and the establishment of its total scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of BA@@ F , VG , the directors &apos; committee , the consulting groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG towards the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties participate in the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom Programme , according to this agreement , is set annually to an amount determined by Eur@@ atom &apos;s content at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Business as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects the common company J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the financial provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Market . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works which are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , intended to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the remaining payment arrangements for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are specified in App@@ endi@@ x III to the present agreement .
Switzerland sei@@ zes all necessary measures so that Eur@@ atom is exemp@@ t from customs or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom which shall be used in Switzerland for activities in the framework of this agreement .
&quot; in this country , the items acquired or acquired in Switzerland may not be dispos@@ ed of either free of charge or free of charge , unless agreed upon by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to rest and car@@ ers who are paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel . &quot;
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Common company J@@ ET , are governed in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Common Market . &quot;
the right of every party to access the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be provided by Switzerland and the individuals or companies that justify research or production activities in Switzerland , which will be communicated in the same conditions as the Member States , individuals or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the research activities in the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third countries , as well as the persons or companies operating in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or an associated third @-@ state research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge . &quot;
&quot; the contracting parties share this knowledge of other countries , persons or companies only if an agreement is made between the parties , unless these individuals or companies operate research or production activities that justify the access to these knowledge . &quot;

I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government on the above . &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements Directive on the mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial state
the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit cards with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks put a corresponding proposal .
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all Member States &apos;s future delivery funds . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned below , to which the B@@ IS would be ready to use . &quot;
&quot; for each stand @-@ by loan , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renewal , but without being exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the opening of the loans , as well as for any extension , the B@@ IS would charge a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draw would not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month following the conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , very likely to be in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the Bank &apos;s means , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those provided by the B@@ IS at the respective time on business transactions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applied to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin of Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the B@@ IS may conclude a stand@@ by credit line with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if banks put a corresponding proposal . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
I encourage you to express the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties agree as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or frozen he@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ asses ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argent@@ ine comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes up the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to bear in mind that the access to Argentina in this Agreement does not affect the Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this Agreement on a ho@@ ist set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the case of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an commerce with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this , under number 5 , will be taken into account of the declaration of withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; the total amount referred to under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community , to 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ asses . &quot;
the community takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the Community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community meets regulations in order to avoid under@@ mining the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the aims and determin@@ ations of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lamb , are only at prices and conditions , which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way compatible with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles 6 , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by issuing export lic@@ ences defined in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the origin in Argentina from the presentation of an export license issued by the competent authorities designated by the Argent@@ ine government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , implementing regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authorities of the Community in regular intervals the amounts issued for the export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions named under number 7 , are of importance . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat will be carried out according to the Community under the agreement . &quot;
the Committee discusses all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the quantity , which is valid from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year , is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal nature of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes which they deemed necessary to be deemed necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would inform your government about this .
I honor me to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep market and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb after the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or frozen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the community in the height specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal he@@ el of its h@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation in co @-@ operation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual amount of the annual amount is not exceeding the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ set quantities are carried out in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ist set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities fixed in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand &apos;s trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in clause 5 will be taken into account . &quot;
the total amount referred to in clause 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 2@@ 45 500 metric tons of car@@ c@@ asses .
&quot; the community takes everything to avoid a market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets regulations so that the sale of intervention states on frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the regulation of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without danger for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lamb are only at prices and conditions , which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the amounts mentioned in clause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences above these quantities .
&quot; the Community , in turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is subject to an export license issued by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , implementing regulations stipul@@ ate that the competent New Zealand authority of the competent authorities of the Community in regular intervals the amounts issued for the export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the Ten@@ dency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of the two contracting parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat should be carried out according to the Community under the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee discusses all questions arising in the implementation of the agreement , presented to it by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the Parties in the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stipul@@ ated in clause 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year shall be determined in relation to the total annual amount .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the main area of New Zealand on the other . &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . &quot;
I honor to suggest if your government can agree to the above that this letter and your reply together constitute an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;

&quot; blood withdrawal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ des through a closed , sterile tube system in a sterile bottle , in which the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ence solution was fu@@ eled before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood withdrawal , the bottle must be closed immediately and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it may be re@@ opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ence solution must not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not be below 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously determined by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is determined by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; in so far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific studies have yiel@@ ded the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du und E. &quot;
the blood exchanged after this agreement should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood must be stored in sterile , closed bottle against micro @-@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the times required for testing and transport , which should be at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood is immediately to cool down to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cells components may be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution , which has been added after the plasma is removed . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ i ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for production must take place under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
&quot; if an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , its volume and composition must be stated on the label . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is extracted by drying the liquid , which is deposited at the top of the cent@@ ering or sedi@@ ment of human solid blocks . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained through cold @-@ drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquids needed to manufacture the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the resulting solution must not be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh serum sample ) a dangerous content of sol@@ es em@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune ha@@ em@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been determined are excluded .
&quot; if plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , which show signs of a bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transfer of ino@@ cul@@ ation @-@ hepatitis , it is possible to take mixtures which do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a similar way . &quot;
&quot; one of the amount of fluid produced during the production of the plasma is to be replaced , the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C. &quot;
&quot; a given quantity of plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid made of it ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) 1 ml solution requires sufficient quantity of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , so it takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the incub@@ ator at 37 ° C. &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ stu@@ ffy drying process in the presence of phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des under pressure of maximum 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight losses over 0.5 % may not occur in the human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nitrogen atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of storing all moisture ; it is protected from light and keep at a temperature below 20 ° C. &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions of human plasma protein are preparations from the protein component , from which about 60 % of the total protein compound of the plasma of human full @-@ blood exist . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container for 10 hours to activate the patho@@ gen of ino@@ cul@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;

a re@@ agent to the blood group determination must react with all blood samples tested that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the titanium is measured by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be studied in a suitable medium .
&quot; the titanium is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum fer@@ til@@ ation , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in volume of the blood cell coating in the total volume . &quot;
&quot; in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International norms , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at present standards . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in single preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ filtration . &quot;
&quot; the titanium gives the re@@ agent &apos;s di@@ lution in the final mixture within a series , where a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International standard preparations are present ( at present anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin of O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B are included in definition 256 International units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain at least one year long . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ ffy form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the governmental supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authority of the state can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent continues to provide the prerequis@@ ites for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ffy or re@@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in a flu@@ ffy form or after recovery , must be transparent and must not contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ ficially colored as possible , at least until an International Convention has come about through a unified system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the amount contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents entered are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to increase the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part into three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each individual container is a black @-@ and @-@ white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum should also cause an easily identifiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) group .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required , if the same tests are performed with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard prepar@@ atory same activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed to an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent inf@@ low of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera every specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species , which differ due to the conditions where ag@@ glut@@ ination is reached hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells . &quot;
&quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved if certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as Rin@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or using other special methods . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies have to be effective simultaneously among the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for the use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be less than with the ant@@ ei@@ ghty antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison body , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in any flush within the double period required , if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ision to ti@@ tr@@ ate blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology has to contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
&quot; it is used by the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , so ag@@ glut@@ inated it no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , no matter what blood group they belong to . &quot;

&quot; anti@@ Le@@ a antibodies are sensi@@ ti@@ zed , and red blood cells that are sensi@@ ti@@ zed with the aforementioned &quot; in@@ complete cold antibodies , &quot; and with tann@@ in treated red blood cells , which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed with human Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin , and finally with 10 different samples of un@@ loaded human red blood cells with and without A@@ - and B @-@ anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ human Glob@@ ulin serum should cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of the red blood cells in the delivered form or in the di@@ lution shown on the label , which is loaded with human in@@ complete anti @-@ D ser@@ a with a Tit@@ er of 1 : 4 ( or less ) , when the ti@@ tr@@ ation is performed with D @-@ positive blood cells after the &quot; Alb@@ um@@ in Re@@ placement &quot; method . &quot;
in the same di@@ lution it is necessary to ag@@ glut@@ inate sensi@@ tised K @-@ positive human red blood cells sensi@@ ti@@ zed by the weak anti @-@ antibodies and the anti @-@ F@@ ya antibodies that are sensi@@ ti@@ zed with the weak anti @-@ F@@ ya antibodies .
&quot; in the same or any other di@@ lution indicated on the label , it also has to ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells , which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak complementary in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , loading with all types of the above @-@ mentioned in@@ complete antibodies should be det@@ ectable with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the seeds or other parts of a suitable plant and , if necessary , subsequent cleansing . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ A re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ anti@@ gens , that is those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A re@@ agent is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparison body , to ti@@ tr@@ ate separately against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of the re@@ agent must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent inf@@ low of A@@ 1 , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in any flush within the double period necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum ( ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( vegetable ) &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the corresponding part of a suitable plant and , if necessary , subsequent cleansing . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ B re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen B , that is those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ ino@@ gen B , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; if anti @-@ B re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent inf@@ low of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The International standard preparation is of human origin ; an appropriate comparison , if necessary , may be human or non @-@ human origin . &quot;
&quot; the Parties to the European Convention on May 14 , 1962 on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; ) - &quot;
&quot; based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , &quot; &quot; Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances made available to them by the other parties of human origin from all entran@@ ces ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls into the jurisdiction of the Community , which is based on the Treaty by which it has been established , which has the authority to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from this date on , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all the states and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection in the sense of Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention . &quot;

&quot; based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , which includes a call to create a European Economic Area , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the borders of countries and the country of origin , &quot;
&quot; decl@@ aring that the Community decided within the Action Plan to strengthen the internal market , as of January 1 , 1988 , to introduce a uniform administration paper , &quot;
&quot; in THE process that it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a uniform administration document , &quot;
&quot; in THE F@@ act , that this Convention may not be interpreted in detail that the contractual parties are binding upon their obligations from other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , and in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; uniform paper &quot; &quot; ) is introduced , which is to be used in particular for all export and import procedures and for goods transport between the contractual parties ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ alities associated with goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single document , for which preliminary prints are to be used according to the samples in Anne@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; according to the case , the uniform paper is used as a registration or paper for export , dispatch and import . &quot;
&quot; - in order to carry out legal provisions in force in a contracting party , whose application is not guaranteed for sole use of the single document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the parties , so that they may come upon request in the enjoyment of a part or some relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent contractual parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the participants . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not to be put at a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; further , the submission of an incomplete application may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed , with the consent of the competent authorities to negotiate a peri@@ odic collective registration within the deadline established by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is allowed to use instead of the single api@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; if the uniform paper is used , the parties with the consent of the competent authorities will be able to include all the form@@ alities associated with the export and import duties instead of the supplement sheets on the trade list in which the goods are described . &quot;
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the form@@ alities for their entire goods or sub @-@ sectors ;
&quot; - for consi@@ gn@@ ments that comprise several types of goods , to be used in the shipping process , instead of the supplementary sheets to the consistency paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow registr@@ ations to be made with public or private data processing facilities according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities , if necessary ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , if necessary without giving a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to fores@@ ee in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , that the export , mail or import registration is either generated by the uniform document created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
- to apply the facil@@ itation adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a decision according to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the form@@ alities required during the export , shipping and import@@ ation of goods are laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the template listed in Anne@@ x I , are to be found in Anne@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration is based in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , approved by the competent authorities of the country in which the form@@ alities for the export or shipping are fu@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country or its representative in this country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In the case of dero@@ gation from paragraph 1 , the registration is always carried out in one of the official languages of the import country , if it is carried out in this country , using other than those submitted by the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may apply for each individual stage of a service agreement between the contractual parties , which can only be used for the provision of the form@@ alities necessary for the provision of the form@@ alities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the expe@@ ditions for the export and the shipping method will be transferred to one and the same pre@@ print using the copies intended for this promotion . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the specimens of the registration has been included in the individual process sections . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) Reg@@ arding a smooth transaction between the contracting parties and facilit@@ ating the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or refu@@ elling , the customs authorities of these countries seek each other on request or - if they respect it from interest to another party party - from themselves all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or denied , if the requested country of the view is that the administrative assistance would imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or harm a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In case of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and the grounds for the seeking country shall be communicated incor@@ rectly . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking office assistance , which it could not afford , if it is requested , it points out in its discretion to this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information received after paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and shall enjoy the protection given to the country &apos;s domestic law that it has received , for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which has issued it , and may otherwise be used elsewhere by the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
( 1 ) A mixture committee is used where every contracting party is represented by this convention .
&quot; ( 4 ) The Committee shall be governed by a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which regul@@ ates the con@@ vocation of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term of office . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may use sub @-@ committees and working groups to support it in its tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee shall have the task of managing this Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; in order to do so , the Committee shall regularly inform the parties of the practical experience with the application of the Convention ; he discusses recommendations and in the cases takes up 3 decisions in the cases . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee decides to change the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party accepts a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided that there is no date , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the repe@@ al of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party meets appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced performance of this Convention , with the need to take into account the form@@ alities that are bur@@ dened with the goods traffic as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions in the case of applying the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas where the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territories of the EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The Convention shall also apply to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein , as long as the Princip@@ ality is linked to the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union contract . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement under a 12 @-@ month deadline ; the written termination is to be directed to the de@@ posit@@ ory mentioned in Article 17 , which is notified to all other contracting parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided the contractual parties have deposited their acceptance certificates with the Council of the European Communities as a de@@ posit@@ ory of the Council of the European Communities by November 1 , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention is not entered into force on 1 January 1988 , the first day of the second month after the final acceptance certificate came into force . &quot;

&quot; I allow myself to propose the following agreement , which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot;
&quot; the European Economic Community , represented by its commission , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Council &quot; &quot; to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will respond as far as possible to this request . &quot;

( translation ) International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System on the term and codi@@ fication of the goods ( events in Brussels on 14 June 1983 )
&quot; the parties of the DI@@ ES@@ ES convention , which have been worked out under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , capturing , comparing and evaluating statistical data , in particular those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH shall reduce the costs resulting from the fact that goods in international trading must be re @-@ referred , re @-@ submitted and re @-@ co@@ ded at the transition from a classification system to another , to facilitate standardi@@ zation of trade documents and transmission of data ; &quot;
&quot; in THE F@@ act that the development of technology and structures of international trade requires significant changes in the Brussels agreement dated 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of goods to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE equ@@ ation that the degree of differentiation required by the governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is contained in the Anne@@ x to the above agreement , &quot;
&quot; in DER E@@ weighing , that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in THE process , that the harmon@@ ized system should be used for freight rates and transport statistics of various modes of transport , &quot;
&quot; in THE process that the harmon@@ ized system is intended to be accepted as far as possible into the systems used in the trade for the designation and coding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in THE process , the harmon@@ ized system should help to establish a close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE A@@ weighing , that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ized system and the International War@@ directory for Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations shall be maintained , &quot;
&quot; in THE F@@ act that it is desirable to comply with the requirements specified above by a combined tari@@ ff and statisti@@ c cl@@ ature , which is suitable for use by international trade involved , &quot;
&quot; in THE process , it is important to ensure adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and structures of international trade ; &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for the Cooperation in the Custom@@ s Area of the Custom@@ s System , for the Harmon@@ ised System in this field , &quot;
&quot; indeed , although the aforementioned agreement on the tari@@ ff scheme has proven to be an effective instrument to achieve some of these objectives , the conclusion of a new international agreement is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this Convention , a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the designation and coding of goods , &quot; referred to in the app@@ endi@@ x to this Convention , consists of the positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from notes to sections . chapters and sub@@ positions as well as the General Rules for the interpretation of the Harmon@@ ised System ; &quot;

amend@@ ment protocol to the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System on the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods ( action to Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
the parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s
&quot; it is desirable that in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of the goods will come into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE F@@ act , that without a change in Article 13 of the Convention , the time of entry into force of this Convention would remain in@@ secure - &quot;
&quot; article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and coding of the goods , referred to in Article 13 of June 14 , 1983 , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; paragraph 1 will receive the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January , following a period of at least three months immediately following the date of which at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or business uni@@ on@@ ers signed in Article 11 have signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or deposited their rati@@ fication or accession documents , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; a . this Protocol takes effect concur@@ r@@ ently with the Convention in force , provided that at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ites signed in Article 11 of the Convention on the adoption of the protocol at the Sec@@ retariat General of the Custom@@ s System . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or customs or business uni@@ on@@ ents can submit a document on the acceptance of this protocol , which have previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time sign or disclose their certificate of rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention or at the same time . &quot;
&quot; B . any state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention on the entry into force of this protocol according to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; a plant which is not only essential for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but also allows the exploitation of land , which does not permit any other planting , and which , even with extensive farming , which makes up the main part of today &apos;s production , is favourable to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS D@@ AR@@ AU@@ F , that from its cultivation it will depend on the existence and living standards of millions of families , which in turn are entirely dependent on measures aimed at maintaining and expanding the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to D@@ AR@@ AU@@ F , that olive oil and table olive oil represent essential ingredients in the areas where olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to D@@ AR@@ AU@@ F , that the essential characteristic of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harvest and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer income ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to D@@ AR@@ AU@@ F , this causes all special difficulties which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in countries where olive growing is common ; &quot;
&quot; among H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F , the extraordinary significance of olive production for the economy of numerous countries , in particular in the development of olive growing countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to D@@ AR@@ AU@@ F , that the measures required in view of the special conditions of olive growing and the market for olive products go beyond the national borders and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
&quot; in view of the 1956 international olive oil convention in its amended version and the International O@@ live Convention of 1963 , in its multiple extended and amended version and the International O@@ live Convention of 1979 ; &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M BE@@ W@@ US@@ ST@@ SE@@ IN , it is essential to continue and develop the work begun within the framework of the so @-@ called Convention , and that it is desirable to include a new agreement - &quot;
&quot; the aims of the International Convention of 1986 on olive oil and table oli@@ v ( in the following as &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; the provisions of resolutions 93 ( IV ) , 124 ( V ) and 155 ( VI ) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development are the following : &quot;
B ) maintain adequate working conditions in olive growing and in the olive industry to raise the standard of living of the populations ;
&quot; C ) the coordination of production , industri@@ alisation and market policy for olive oil , olive oil and table oli@@ v and the organisation of the market for these products ; &quot;
