&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the packing supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of fusion tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inhal@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B . wir@@ l thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have different episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for preventing man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the fusion tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are eliminated equally as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this interfer@@ es with the transmission of signal between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot;
ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , works to a lesser extent than neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which prevents recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies over a period of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared with a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest by the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resor@@ bed to the fusion tablets and the solution to assimil@@ ate ( assimil@@ ated ) .
&quot; in both studies with injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than those receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to restore man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15@@ mg doses were also less effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled cra@@ cking ) , vom@@ iting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , were out@@ weighed against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a licence for the transfer of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients showing predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and mood disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over @-@ line disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia have been treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; thus ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole results in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; considering the common administration of eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ orph@@ an ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ than@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those with lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , and their appearance reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma loss . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ C receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study meditation was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was significantly reduced by 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ than@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a review effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially or over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy resulted in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ isation over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , nor did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a detailed analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study for patients with different h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional methods of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ ples of the average Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of apes after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ ples of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the central Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs to release single doses of aluminium into folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; 34 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , may take the processed tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and mood disorders , in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ than@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form for healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ ples of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the central Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be administered depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medication to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for inser@@ ting . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ap@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over @-@ line disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ging was greater compared to that after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were applied as one @-@ off of intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in common use of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those with lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , and their appearance reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and Beh@@ avi@@ our@@ al Dys@@ function was the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ap@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm . &quot;
&quot; observed mean improvement of initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score during the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe an@@ gi@@ dity , a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medi@@ tations were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and half @-@ operation ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ than@@ in controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially or over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy resulted in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension of study in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a period of stabili@@ zation prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formul@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was applied at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the administration of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns for mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times of the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in overall study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated patients responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in view of the efficacy indicators such as time and the worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival , only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer did not make any difference between the drugs . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be applied to patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that , in patients with the first treatment , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy drugs to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a licence for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ anes throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , grade 3 is to inter@@ rupt the treatment until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired kidney function were conducted and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which may have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ inflammatory and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women at child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients , who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes , are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the course of treatment with Abra@@ x@@ anes , the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility is to be advised by male patients . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , chest pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , muscular sp@@ as@@ ms , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance which promotes the accumulation of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ans and stabil@@ ises micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ ine transm@@ its the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and within the scope of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sit@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the tumour area due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two in@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without any medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a reduced general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; first @-@ line therapy , are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Tier 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for ph@@ asing on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel within 30 and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ anes in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the treatment of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the application of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ be and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean for cum@@ ulative leak@@ age of 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be cau@@ tious when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution . &quot;
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solids . &quot;
then the jum@@ per should be turned and / or inver@@ ted slowly and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete reset of the powder is carried out .
&quot; if precip@@ itation or zinc is visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently in order to achieve a complete reset prior to the application . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml @-@ suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot;

&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine containing therapies . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane must not be used : • if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other ingredients of Abra@@ x@@ ane • if you are breast@@ feeding • if your white blood cells are degra@@ ded ( initial values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about it )
&quot; special caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have impaired kidney function • if you suffer from num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness • if you suffer from severe liver problems - if you have heart problems &quot;
&quot; use Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines Please inform the doctor if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs , as they may cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ anes . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; furthermore , they should be advised against the treatment of sperm preservation , as the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility exists through the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ anes . &quot;
traffic @-@ ti@@ ghtness and the use of machines Abra@@ x@@ anes can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines .

member states must ensure that the holder of the marketing authorisation for the market launch will provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contributions . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological product , which has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also referred to as &quot; reference doctors &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if there is no blood @-@ bleeding prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be performed by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ dependency or because the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference drug . &quot;
&quot; in all participating patients , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before being either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continuing to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of der@@ p@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling migr@@ ating mi@@ gra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ ys@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the drug shows a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a licence for the distribution of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; an@@ a@@ emia management and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( such as cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia during the start of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should be carried out only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger surgical interventions ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used without iron deficiency in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that can not be part of an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may be different depending on age , gender and general disease ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required . &quot;
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest approved dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and general disease burden ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest approved dose , which is required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained once a week . &quot;
&quot; if hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the particle number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the lab@@ yrinth rate by ≥ 400 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the prec@@ tik@@ u@@ loid number increased by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , and the response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg to 10 consecutive days each , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not involved in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carcin@@ oma or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently encountered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ic ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the lab@@ ial cell value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ om@@ or@@ to@@ xi@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the partic@@ u@@ loid value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an examination of bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target in maintenance therapy . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit caused by epo@@ e@@ ines , when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in input should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin should be based on a benefit @-@ risk @-@ weighing under the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is not possible to exclude that during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ e@@ ine has not been proven that cancer patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia will improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported . &quot;
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; independent of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it is possible for surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and i@@ den@@ tically identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis was not affected .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ hist@@ om@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 Non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ hist@@ om@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 lung cancer omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; in 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 Mam@@ ma@@ carb@@ ons , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis . &quot;
survival and progression progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no stimulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared with the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximately 20 times the weekly dose recommended for humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , to delay the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uns@@ af@@ e Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued label , so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target in maintenance therapy . &quot;
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in input should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation has ensured that the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. is established and functional before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the drug used in the traffic is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the marketing authorisation is obliged to conduct the studies listed in the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and to update the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • to obtain new information , which could have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures within 60 days after an important ( the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or Risk Re@@ duction ) . &quot;
&quot; • Dur@@ ing a month before your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from an unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased breast pain ) - the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) - if , for example , occurred earlier such a blood drop occurred &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe bleeding disturbances of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sive disease ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ en@@ oid ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood counts within the normal range , which re@@ stores again during further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before starting treatment . &quot;
the occurrence of ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ sti@@ tis after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin has been reported very rare .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may pose the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are in the normal range again . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels will not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
your doctor will regularly determine your blood levels ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ d@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is imminent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; if your levels of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ sen@@ amed because there is increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / apply them recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means for building the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor holds this appropriate for you , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , transi@@ ent circulation disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;
&quot; eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ic means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section called &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; after repeated blood donations , it can come regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - a blood drop formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed may be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ gra@@ ding after surgery ( postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your output mo@@ b is too high

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a slight hip frac@@ ture like H@@ inf@@ ra ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50@@ 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) before the first in@@ fusion or through injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme , which breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared with the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta adverse events occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to t@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion center and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to distribute A@@ cla@@ sta in the European Union . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Pa@@ get disease with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily minimum 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; patients with kidney function disorders ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data for safety and effectiveness are missing .
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of zinc cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily minimum 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients needing dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the O@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently developed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area was reported , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis in the jaw area of one with A@@ cla@@ sta and in a placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were removed one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to placebo .
&quot; bone sales markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; total mort@@ em mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times . &quot;
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the total rate and 4,@@ 3 % on the fem@@ oral neck . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was compared to the once @-@ weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate based on the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mostly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ mal age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
&quot; 11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid , compared to the intake of 30@@ mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months , was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies . &quot;
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate after 6 months . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response was given in 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared with 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma rose rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clearing is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose , and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zinc cit@@ ric acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans , and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance , and was in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the t@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; as for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are 6@@ times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was given in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the multiple of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;

&quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in breast@@ feeding women • Requi@@ rement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • V@@ alid for medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System described in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and during the product . &quot;
the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP in the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan ( R@@ MP ) is required .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medi@@ cam@@ ents , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is announced , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • At the request of E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis is a member of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; dimin@@ ishing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction occurs too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation , thereby adding strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines / apply them recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; because A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need a more dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss A@@ cla@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta in case you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the following in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; at present , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta has caused this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or craw@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; headache , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling / stit@@ ch feeling , di@@ zz@@ iness , trem@@ bling , stomach upset , abdominal pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , stomach pain , nausea , stomach upset , headache , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash , skin rash . &quot;
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture have been recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of zinc cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the packing supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who are overweight ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or those overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond , one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies have been conducted to over 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting smoking in comparison to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to estimate in this area of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete listing associated with A@@ comp@@ lia reported side @-@ effects is the package supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is provided with simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , p@@ k@@ ai@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of reducing weight in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) and around AR@@ Z
&quot; it also contributes to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which additionally have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , due to lack of data for effectiveness and harm@@ lessness . &quot;
&quot; depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported with up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant must not be applied in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close relatives are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort , has not been studied , is believed to be the simultaneous offering of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;

&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease of the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated Type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 was placebo I
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight difference between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were approximately 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and accounted for about 50 % by weight reduction . n ° AR@@ Z
&quot; after 13 days , the Ste@@ ady State plasma gas was reached ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ l = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; influence of food : he subjects that received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in wet conditions or after a fat @-@ rich meal , reported in the case of food intake a 67 % hei@@ gh@@ tened C@@ MA@@ x resp@@ . by 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ular analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Evidence @-@ clinical data for the safety of these adverse events , which were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic field , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases seems to be the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects on the fertility or cycle disturbances were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not shown .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which allows type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg when applying the dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who included Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , reported a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took additional placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can neither be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) , Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ phs are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ stomach pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are to be checked . &quot;
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patients with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters are submitted by the clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can move from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , it was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures oc@@ cured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in increasing the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not appreciated from present data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ an@@ asc@@ ents above the triple of the upper limit of the normal range also frequently occurred as placebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
&quot; since the market launch , heart failure has rarely been reported under pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , but more often , if pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of adverse events in bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparison medi@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years running Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; at intake of the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is rel@@ ap@@ sed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimisation with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials for one year under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slight but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid reduced total plastic matri@@ ces and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was not only reduced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both on an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized to receive either pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral exposure of radio@@ actively lab@@ elled pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ zes ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia associated with the gest@@ ation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in increased frequency of colon tumours .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures oc@@ cured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
in another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in clinical trials over one year under Pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both on an effect on the tr@@ yp@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and also on the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ em , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events in bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures oc@@ cured at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ glit@@ az@@ one was not only reduced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both on an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in treating diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensified insulin therapy may be able to alter the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , mark ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ based origin ) can cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is necessary during the change to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first few weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients after other medications taken by them .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
nervous system disorders - peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually rever@@ sible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin diseases and skin tissue connec@@ tive tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur if missed to change the pun@@ cture points within the injection area .
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system Yellow - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disturbances , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / Consci@@ ousness . &quot;
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can however be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum dose is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effectiveness is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on the conventional methods of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle is taken from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) , before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for use . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .

&quot; before each injection , check if there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to ensure an even mixture . &quot;
&quot; follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards , gently knock your fingers against the cartridge a few times . &quot;
&quot; if air bubbles are present , they will accumulate in the cartridge above . while Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let continues to hold up with the injection needle , press the cartridge at one click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure D ) • Now you have to put a drop of insulin out of the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; • Ke@@ ep the cap back so on the ready @-@ made pen , that the digit 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Figure E ) • Check if the button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if not , turn the cap until the push button is pressed completely • Ke@@ ep your Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let horizont@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the cap next to the metering stamp • Note the highest number you can see on the press dial • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the closing cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise insulin is extracted from the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct . if you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps : &quot;
then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering brand lies opposite .
make sure to press the button only during the injection . • Ke@@ ep the button pressed after the injection until the needle has been removed from the skin .
&quot; if not , turn the cap until the push button is fully pushed down and then proceed as described in Before Use • P@@ ossi@@ bly you will hear a cli@@ ck@@ able sound when pressing the push button . &quot;
it may be in@@ accurate • You can &apos;t set any dose that is higher than the number of remaining units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; furthermore , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for placing Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
&quot; if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must be raised first , then the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary during the change to Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;

&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum dose is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total effectiveness is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id was studied in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data are limited , but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin humane in the in@@ fusion fluid 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ; 5 % D glucose and 10 % D@@ - Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature .

&quot; follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards , gently knock your fingers against the cartridge a few times . &quot;
&quot; when air bubbles are present , they will accumulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge - While the needle continues to move upwards , press the cartridge at one click in the direction of the arrow ( figure C ) • Now you have to put a drop of insulin out of the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; • Ke@@ ep the cap back so on the ready @-@ made pen , that the digit 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Figure D ) • Check if the button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if the button can not move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push button ( push button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;

turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you can feel a resistance . then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering brand lies opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the button pressed after the injection until the needle has been removed from the skin .
&quot; it may be in@@ accurate • You can &apos;t set any dose that is higher than the number of remaining units remaining • You can use the remaining scale scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust your dose or select . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used for patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ lim@@ k@@ notes ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there is still a risk of g@@ out attacks ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take more medicines to prevent rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with that of a placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving a dose of 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily intake 120 m@@ g. a day in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver results . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia in diseases that have already led to plaque buil@@ du@@ p ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available plaster no@@ des and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum @-@ res@@ ic acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicines , it may occur during the treatment beginning to an acute g@@ out attack because , by lowering the serum pole , ur@@ inary acid deposits in the tissue can initially be mobil@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before beginning of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or and in the further course of the clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll in Z@@ e were no interaction studies conducted at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lic mirror ( a blocking of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous injection of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x a day was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with volunteers an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , showed a moderate 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the intake of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not allow side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at to close to pregnancy or fet@@ us health .
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 4 years long with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ an@@ esth@@ esia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , short@@ ness of skin , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , erectile dysfunction , decrease of the number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , decrease of the number of white blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ inal metabolism and arises in the context of the reaction sk@@ e@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → Harn@@ oric acid . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is an effective , non Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients , where the last three monthly ser@@ pent@@ ine levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg . &quot;
the reduction in serum urine acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum inf@@ ect@@ ins &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function limitation The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of ser@@ um@@ ina acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 shown in two years showed that the permanent lowering of serum @-@ res@@ ic acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a pla@@ iting rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the plaster node , which resulted in 54 % of the patients complete disappearance of the plaster no@@ des by month 24 . &quot;
elevated T@@ SH@@ A values ( &gt; 5.5 μ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also for patients receiving allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are produced mainly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; besides ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at was about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of 1@@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver Dys@@ function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( child @-@ pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In males rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ dose treated group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4.3 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , resulting in a decrease in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in bearing rats with ex@@ positions , roughly 4,@@ 3 times and in bearing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were approximately the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term renewal studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 4 years long with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients , where the last three monthly ser@@ pent@@ ine levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 shown in two years showed that the permanent lowering of serum @-@ res@@ ic acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients required a treatment against a pla@@ iting rate ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data that indicates that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE exactly matches the dose needed for preventing bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive organs such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , sor@@ es ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , sp@@ ook@@ y abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic sur@@ facing . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd . a licence for the distribution of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor is therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential adverse reactions , and patients should be pointed out to remedy symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ ale pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or , following the appearance of symptoms , which point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in large @-@ scale clinical trials involving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate there was no increased risk , rarely ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens mainly include intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether the setting of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients needing a ortho@@ don@@ tic intervention dimin@@ ishes the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noted their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated appropriately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor of breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate have no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also in case of o@@ steopor@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the serum intake of serum amounts up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sequence of oral over@@ dose may occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III trials of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % in the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % on the trough . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo -@@ 6.2 % ) was achieved in the share of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year pro@@ long@@ ation of these studies , the BM@@ D &apos;s asc@@ ents of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to uph@@ old ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was also maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption Be@@ ate to an intraven@@ ous dose of reference was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the F@@ ä@@ zes . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects people &apos;s ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although there are no clinical data about it , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at as in the animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased stimulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

an@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , comparing the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how adv@@ agra@@ m compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , headache , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood glucose levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with adv@@ agra@@ m , as the an@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time has to be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ arded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ s@@ ular part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule section with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should be carried out only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; following a switch to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dose of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level determin@@ ations ( see below &quot; Rec@@ ommen@@ dations &quot; )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 systemic exposure measured as tal@@ low level , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients was comparable . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application For suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adap@@ tations can be required later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be a transplan@@ t receptor of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ms , this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ance once daily the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must start for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients , who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ m , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily one day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ ms in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , gra@@ ft transplan@@ ted patients showed a oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
&quot; since ren@@ al function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ esses and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ms In switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case by means of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood @-@ levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after migration from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ m , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances which could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml , and with heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft receivers in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the ing@@ es@@ tion of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies should be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ m ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a corneal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ burden and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; because Adv@@ agra@@ ms contain hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose , in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , special caution is provided . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal inter@@ change . &quot;
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is affected . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone level , decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the balance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not provide any indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposition , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ kal@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects are listed following their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often elevated in patients with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which often increases suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be conveyed by binding to cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent from T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; 175 treatment transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a colon transplan@@ t as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies accounted for the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being killed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3,@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in a study the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target levels of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ eous radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite value and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the g@@ all . &quot;
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in the case of stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .

advance is used to treat and prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital disorder disorder caused by the lack of Factor VI@@ II .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advance is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , capable of forming the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years of age , were examined for the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ate in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; advances may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for the transport of lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of Factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients less than 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to control the dose of VI@@ II plasma . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dose should be administered after the patient is diagnosed , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , with the risk being the largest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the case of pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II @-@ product was changed to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ low ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VI@@ II is no experience during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which were previously untreated patients with a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated by the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E @-@ in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the plasma and the clearance rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
&quot; in addition , no of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) diagnosed a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after exposure to factor VI@@ II concentration ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited informed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surrounds and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of oneself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have directly inj@@ ected into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs was involved in the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers to the questions asked by the company , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the documents submitted at the beginning , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors brings benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not proven sufficiently that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; com@@ promis@@ sive @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified ingredient release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when viewing all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported that the a@@ ze was 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunt ) , mouth @-@ dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is completely swal@@ lowed ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under the age of 12 due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after hearing the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if required . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks of completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , erg@@ ot@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ olin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ha@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or p@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised when treating the following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be de@@ composed for at least 48 hours prior to the testing of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ kas otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n not inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to frequency in normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mus@@ cul@@ ature , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , heart rhythm , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; for a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on the standard measurement variables of the flights , including the strengthening of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall results for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the s@@ wollen effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in view of gender , age or ethnic background , the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy volunteers over 14 days , the fluid balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on the conventional trials of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n however do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the marketing authorisation application described pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , can develop its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of ab@@ sent@@ ing drugs called pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine which is included in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach exit or the du@@ o@@ den@@ um ( respiratory tract ) , a prostate gland enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze • blood pressure • heart hunt , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when applying in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or lowers the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; heart pal@@ pit@@ ations or cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , increased physical activity , redness , hot flas@@ hes , confusion , bl@@ urred vision , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , nas@@ al irrit@@ ation , anxiety , anxiety and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , in@@ som@@ nia , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver values was also very rarely reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for inhal@@ ing ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of fusion tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ elling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptoms number ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the reduction of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the symptom scores after 6 weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n among young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression , and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy season a continuous treatment . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , which was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be classified in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; as hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also leads to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and his awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with a des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfasts ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional methods of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m less , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , slightly wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance strain ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this drug . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol intake was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose dose study of adults and adolescents , which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged 1 to 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of des@@ lor@@ dosis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not impaired by psych@@ om@@ otor functions in adults and adolescents in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with che@@ wing parasites ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which are restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation following daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
in different single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is offered in type III li@@ que@@ fied bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene inter@@ facing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inser@@ ting with scales of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
&quot; a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to take once daily in the mouth , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose dose study used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , which was used in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; for a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including the strengthening of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg fusion tablets once daily in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n among young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the group of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , which was used in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; for a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including the strengthening of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inhal@@ ation the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet once daily in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , which was used in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; for a 30 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inhal@@ ation the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablet showed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se @-@ is@@ som@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this drug . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported in placebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years with a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable in pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially notified to the Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread from humans to humans because human beings have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
&quot; when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies fast in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane surface of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body alien ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ Gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inhal@@ ing , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; am@@ er@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral medication the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ per@@ age is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ Gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and therefore the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the medicine as@@ cer@@ ase with low dose , reduced to low dose , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml under A@@ Gener@@ ase after 48 weeks , but A@@ Gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , the viral load decreased , however , only very few were treated by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine used with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ Gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , r@@ ashes and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ Gener@@ ase should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; am@@ er@@ ase should also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded in the same way as ather@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV there is a risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; unusual circumstances , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ Gener@@ ase in the European Union .
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inhal@@ ing is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule , hence , A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily , together with 100 mg of k@@ ron@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; 2 If A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ per@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ says should not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a small therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ says or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to curing HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ Gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ Gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ id , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous oral administration with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulations R@@ atio ) , methods for determining drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ Gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should be monitored for op@@ i@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if they are given even lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ Gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase should be reduced in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy were necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ related factors , such as a longer persi@@ sting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; Hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in hem@@ at@@ omas , including spontaneously cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeu@@ tical lati@@ tude should not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a small therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeu@@ tical lati@@ tude A@@ Gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmaceuticals , whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to equ@@ alize the degra@@ ded plas@@ m@@ RNA through a dose enhancement of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already has St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , to check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg taken twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment plan . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg ri@@ p@@ c@@ p@@ inion twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ ron@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous dosing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to close mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to be used in combination with diar@@ rhe@@ a in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acids component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ Gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in could possibly reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous injection of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ bet@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ says , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plas@@ m@@ RNA levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interactions in common with as@@ says . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ says .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids do not take at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it may cause resor@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ae known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ard@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had been given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plasma level rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ stero@@ ids unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism varies greatly from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time being administered by A@@ Gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma lip@@ sing increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous injection of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is not allowed to be used along with oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while caution is advised when using as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma gas of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ i@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses given by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given at the moment , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dosage is to be adapted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in the simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with concur@@ rent administration of as@@ says ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ Gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , oc@@ cured early and rarely led to a treatment break . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of A@@ Gener@@ ase or another drug used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of as@@ cer@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as during the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ via fat accumulation . &quot;
113 anti@@ retro@@ viral persons treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks were only one case ( sti@@ cking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception were increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which were received with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of viral and ga@@ g @-@ polar poly@@ pro@@ ein@@ formation with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r blo@@ ated treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study showed a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 where 14 isol@@ ates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies that sell diagnostic resist@@ ances have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , c@@ love avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r stays in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ Gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ ans@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard treatment ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) received with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of non @-@ blo@@ ated A@@ Gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ Gener@@ ase was tested three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ Gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ cooked &quot; &quot; as@@ says should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration at the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous dietary intake influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; from the solution , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ bo@@ sis Solution and A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment regi@@ mens perform to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that are performed on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous oral administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , ker@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas appear in dos@@ ages with 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of as@@ says nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed , pointing to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ per@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function disorders , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulations R@@ atio ) , methods for determining drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg ri@@ p@@ c@@ p@@ inion twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ ron@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous dosing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to close mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
&quot; caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ says , a reduction of the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ard@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had been given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plasma level rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the simultaneous offering of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous oral administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ cooked &quot; &quot; as@@ says should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance should be limited to the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , ker@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas were present in dos@@ ages with 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in young , the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over , the A@@ Gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of patients with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ generative Solution for inser@@ ting was neither covered with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inhal@@ ing is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule , hence , A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution for inhal@@ ing ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ per@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ Gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination should be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ Gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially provoke serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ says or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to curing HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ Gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of sending HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ulations R@@ atio ) , methods for determining drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; should a skin rash be accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; Hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in hem@@ at@@ omas , including spontaneously cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am are expected after oral administration of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ bo@@ lic solution for inhal@@ ing may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of A@@ Gener@@ ase or another drug used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r blo@@ ated treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
early termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ cooked &quot; &quot; as@@ says should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large c@@ ous@@ al volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed , pointing to a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; - If any of the listed side effects are adver@@ sely affected or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to use A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ Gener@@ ase .
the use of as@@ says will be based on the individual viral resistance test performed by your doctor and your treatment history .
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above diseases or take any of the above mentioned drugs .
&quot; if your doctor recommends that you take A@@ Gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to reinforce the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure that before beginning treatment you have read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully . &quot;
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effectiveness of children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients less than 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; for this reason , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ Gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ Gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control the bleeding . − For patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking certain medicines that can lead to serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in , may minimize potential safety problems . &quot;
it is recommended that HIV positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
traffic light@@ ness and the operation of machines There were no studies on the influence of carri@@ er@@ ase on the driving capability or the ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; if you take Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after as@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of A@@ Gener@@ ase can be dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; dose of A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily , together with 100 mg of k@@ ron@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is administered three times a week for six weeks , with four weeks of interval between treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo were performed either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis .
&quot; • In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete cure rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with placebo showed a complete cure rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , ak@@ tin@@ ischen Ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is continued until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed should another therapy be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can be applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied skin area infected with clin@@ ically , until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily famili@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with one for circumc@@ ision were observed . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after the treatment with other cut@@ ane@@ ously applied methods for the treatment of external clin@@ ically in@@ clin@@ able in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital and peripheral areas there is no clinical experience so far .
&quot; limited data may point to an increased rate of clin@@ ker reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in regard to the elimination of the clin@@ ker war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
&quot; following the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed approximately 12 weeks after the treatment ends . &quot;
&quot; since there are currently no data available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in the case of super @-@ certified bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre@@ treated tumours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip area . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent kerat@@ osis in anatom@@ ic locations outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; available data on the lower arms and hands on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions frequently occur but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial highlights that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
&quot; due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after a one @-@ time nor after repeated topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been reached , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly shared and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in related side @-@ effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side @-@ effects are presented below .
&quot; the most common , as likely , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; according to the review of the clinical signs , this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial investig@@ ates three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review of the clinical signs , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream very often resulted in severe ery@@ thropo@@ ids ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ oring and ru@@ ining ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dentally one @-@ time oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , equivalent to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation the systemic concentration of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
&quot; in 3 phase @-@ relevant Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete curing of the cow@@ ards during an i@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of all patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients treated the clin@@ ker completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ year use per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary end@@ othel@@ ial cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all patients treated clin@@ ically and stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic active les@@ ions within a connected 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of superficial clin@@ ker , ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis and super @-@ defici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0,1 , 0,2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated apparent half @-@ life was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the sorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis or super @-@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the paint application showed no similar effects with the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during mal@@ administration three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very small due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the efficacy @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; ● Whe@@ el war@@ ts ( con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) , is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if it remains untreated , it can lead to de@@ formation , especially in the face . therefore , early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to much of the sun during their previous life . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only in case of flat ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations before starting treatment , please inform your doctor before you have problems with your immune system . &quot;
&quot; if you have acci@@ dentally contact the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . do not rin@@ se the cream in@@ wardly . if reactions occur in the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cl@@ utter@@ ed , you can continue the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin can be expected . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a Creme in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with cow@@ war@@ ts in the genital area during the infection , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is after sexual intercourse ( not before ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; breast@@ feed your infant during the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme , as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od will sur@@ pass the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different for clin@@ ching , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin place with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
&quot; men with fores@@ kin under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin each day and wash the skin area beneath it ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Creme ? &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .

&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more vulnerable to infections ; it can cause you to develop a blue stain sooner or cause it to cause fatigue .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , it is about lighter skin reactions that res@@ ound within about 2 weeks after the treatment is removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sc@@ oring , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule is recommended for these patients .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule is recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies form against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a prolonged period of inter@@ ruption , due to the theoretically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , caution must be cau@@ tious . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or antibodies ) to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe form of decay and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came to a serum version within 3 months after the treatment was started , with a more severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation in the patients at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom there was never a serum version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasoning for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to perform in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportional to the size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decline in the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe form of occ@@ lu@@ sion and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was noted after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , assess each year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional trials of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is missing either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have performed a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you are using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for physicians or medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes gradually to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; but in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and fac@@ i@@ als . &quot;
&quot; very common ( appearance with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ aches • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • In@@ fusion • hyper@@ tension • L@@ ess oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of leak@@ age bottles to be dil@@ uted after the body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have not yet been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than only therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ angi@@ ble &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of liquid ) should be given before or after the administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose may be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therefore s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more light in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of treatment in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with ast@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparative medication . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
&quot; each cylinder must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ - sis is removed from the throughput bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - kal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma except for pre@@ valent hard @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75@@ mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid has to be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
&quot; patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose , and after each third treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ v. , a complete blood pattern should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ c@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ induc@@ es a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies show no indication that patients at the age of 65 years or older compared to patients at the age of 65 have an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , dose adap@@ tations were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times the upper bili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.@@ 0@@ multiple of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ row suppression and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be given to patients , before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ y- lac@@ tic measure for reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ sis ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ v. have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage of the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ lo@@ sis ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g. a day ) can lead to a reduced breakdown of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses should be applied in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ v. has to be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulations R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ v. in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage of the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment , to consult with regard to the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ ial cells , and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; frequent frequency : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( not estim@@ able on the basis of available data from spontaneous reports ) . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , comprised su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mics . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in phase 2 , similar to the phase 2 described above ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared with 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and well @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .

&quot; in clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding ) were reported in patients with pancre@@ atic treatment ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical trials , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were occasionally reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ v. therapy . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its action by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ac@@ eous metabolic processes , which are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple attacks by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ l@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ c@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received treatment arms in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in comparison with the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control lar@@ m .
&quot; a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC resulted in medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival occurred in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ post@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel is similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSCLC Hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = interval @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ margin limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the patients needed sel@@ f@@ - ten@@ er the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparation ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ otherapeu@@ tic agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found again within 24 hours after the application , unchanged in the urine . &quot;
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total dose of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , sti@@ cky changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ est epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not applied excell@@ ently , the retention times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the contents of the 100 mg fusion bottles with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml per mixed @-@ mixed . &quot;

&quot; each cylinder must be dissolved with 20 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; 23 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;

&quot; in patients with no previous chemotherapy , A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used to treat malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ i@@ oma ( malign@@ ant disease of the rib@@ bed ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer . &quot;
&quot; if you have kidney problems or earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist , as you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion blood tests ; it will check whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or stop treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
&quot; if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent vom@@ iting before and after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; if you have a fluid accumulation around your lungs , your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to become a child during the treatment or during the first six months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions Please tell your doctor if you are using medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as drugs called &quot; non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ lo@@ sis &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) , including medicines that are not prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the planned da@@ - tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take , and when . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescribed for prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; a hospital doctor , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be you cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( equivalent to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ son two times a day ) , which you must take on the day before , during and after the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be you fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for intake or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 mc@@ g ) , which you must take during the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA one time a day . &quot;

&quot; it is used for obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who are taking All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats that have been added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg for placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ eling , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stools , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it should not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ treatment syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast @-@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ sc@@ ented diet . &quot;
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only partially resor@@ bed , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjusting the dosage . &quot;
• Pre@@ sensitivity to the substance or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Time breast@@ feeding ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of the occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take supplementary contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures , in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
in a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a sin@@ king of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as beta carot@@ ene , remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take supplements of a mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after a single dose of am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a minor decrease in the am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known adverse events identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain@@ ties . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times a day over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ h@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ene rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a share of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist measurements mean the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in the case of therapeutic doses , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was given the minimal systemic resor@@ b@@ ted dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 at position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as at this time you may not have reduced fat content in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise diet @-@ related complications : • Beg@@ in for a few days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; • Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store any medication after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Do not keep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed trays with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;

&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories you are suitable for . • D@@ ue to the mode of operation of the capsule , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related complications . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously approximately 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , for example , through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Cri@@ tical is a food diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate release for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medication which can be used as an anti@@ angi@@ ble agent ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; in the case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate release for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ oh@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit from Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to appro@@ ve the distribution of Alo@@ xi within the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with high @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon massage , patients should be closely monitored with am@@ nesty or signs of sub@@ acute isch@@ emia following injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with concur@@ rent administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy regi@@ men , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days of chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chemotherapy drugs ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ubi@@ cin , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;

&quot; there are no experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common side effects observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were associated with al@@ op@@ ha@@ gia , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ st@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of un@@ desirable events were seen as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a high @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of high @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations suggest that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with that measured value measured after once intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and around 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abo@@ lization we have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function , terminal elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , however , reducing the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications are that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since al@@ al@@ ma@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;
the owner of this authorisation for the transport must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the medicine approved in the context of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended for the distribution of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ friendly ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; reference doctors &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme al@@ in- amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , measured how many patients responded after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes .
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease reli@@ ed again on more patients than with the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ mates ( cra@@ cking or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because it may not work against these kinds of infections . &quot;
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied for patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should re @-@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ utter@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that al@@ tar@@ go in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common adverse effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risk of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a licence for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials involving secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous treatment of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations in humans following topical application ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adap@@ tations are not held if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are insufficient regarding a statement on effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should be applied only if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
the decision whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; function Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide dy@@ l@@ dron , blocking partial P @-@ binding adjustment and preventing the normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin may seem question@@ able at at least some infection forms , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion to intact and on sk@@ ul@@ led skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic image of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat @-@ micro@@ nucleus test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were no signs of reduced fertility in male or female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to people ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ e@@ wed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been determined . &quot;

&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area indicate , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with al@@ tar@@ go if it is not explicitly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment dies off on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium pou@@ ch containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ matrix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , however , Ambi@@ matrix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses may lead to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ matrix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ matrix contains the same components as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but in the case of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given to children . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ matrix and Twin@@ rix contain grown @-@ up ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ matrix . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ da led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient atmosphere in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ matrix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ matrix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the vacc@@ ination plan for pri@@ mer imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ matrix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her , both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under certain circumstances , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody level is achieved so that in these cases the administration of other vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , however , Ambi@@ matrix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously , as there can be bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ matrix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diet , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mass m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ my vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ ghs and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , Ambi@@ matrix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ matrix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ matrix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the test subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given an appointment were over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation , however , was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received the Ambi@@ matrix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the test persons receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in combination with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ matrix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ ines reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ matrix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; serum levels for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , a month of 6 prescribed dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ matrix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ atorial vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambi@@ matrix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ matrix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; for persons who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ matrix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which was determined after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12 to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ matrix in the second year of life was administered at the same time using a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mass m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ my vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conversion rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the withdrawal by eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC amended version , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorised laboratory for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in polluted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ matrix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of being vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ matrix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can cause it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ matrix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a combined Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; even if you / your child are weakened by illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immunity , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ matrix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines / in@@ takes ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / or have received / has or is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ matrix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ matrix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , ambient pregnant women or breast@@ feeding women will not be administered unless it is urgent that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ matrix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; extremely common ( more than 1 case per 10 c@@ apped doses ) : • pain or discomfort in the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ri@@ ousness • irrit@@ ability • headache , loss of appetite &quot;
&quot; ( up to 1 case per 10 c@@ apped doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • De@@ ad@@ age , gastro@@ intestinal complaints &quot;
&quot; further side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 printed doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extensive erup@@ tions that can be it@@ ching or b@@ lower , swelling of the eye contours and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflamm@@ ations of some blood vessels discomfort or illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea and abdominal pain . increased tendency to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by waste of the amount of blood . &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects causes you / your child significantly or you notice side effects that are not stated in this pack .
&quot; Ambi@@ matrix is available in packs of 1 and 10 , with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been known since the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP viewed the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ matrix is positive . &quot;
&quot; however , because Ambi@@ matrix was only brought into traffic in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is administered - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ ole ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a bog@@ us drug , that is , without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , loss of taste , loss of taste or flavour , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle effectively prevented too high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was prescribed . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life month ) , there is an indication of the use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ takes .
&quot; patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma associated with ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate over the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should only be used with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred with a 5 month old infant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease , with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns , was almost always inf@@ ecting , and the disease even led to death during treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative forms of nitrogen precip@@ itation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) diagnosed with 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the initial appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it came with the time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ kan@@ oid scar@@ let ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neurological condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to individual and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined 15 minutes after the intake . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ cal disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in the next morning after night fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations on the third day were five times higher than according to the first gifts . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of a con@@ ju@@ gated product , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ined effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic t@@ ins ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children not able to swallow tablets or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia or nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ takes .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , corresponding 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) there were les@@ ions in the cran@@ ial cells of the cor@@ tex .
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate is produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even during treatment , and a further worsen@@ ing of neurological conditions may occur in some patients . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined 15 minutes after the intake . &quot;
&quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can &apos;t ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , loss of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms with you , immediately contact your doctor or emergency room in order to initiate appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the box and the container after the exp@@ iry date specified .
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses oral or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose , which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; • In@@ take out of the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Cover a straight edge , e.g. a knife press over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended amount of measuring spoon gran@@ ules out of the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in case of inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ aly measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without administration of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox regarding all indicators was just as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the distribution of angi@@ ox across the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous detachment of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a radius of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous detachment of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us dose of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI interference is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the dose dose can be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with ACS ) or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose can be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after receiving the bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine bol@@ us with no dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• severe hyper@@ tension caused by the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ant is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in the case of PCI @-@ patients under bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vali@@ ant , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after de@@ composition of the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is once again reached before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ am@@ ines with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly in each case . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are insufficient regarding the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ant group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women and in patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined after the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed vascular loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
&quot; the following information on adverse events is based on the data of a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ ant in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI study . &quot;
&quot; in both the group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system groups in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains a bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ ine inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the anim@@ e bond region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or coag@@ ul@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn slowly divi@@ des the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) could indu@@ ce no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration dependent anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is evi@@ den@@ ced by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , ACT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following patients , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ vering inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or on the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study the characteristics of high risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography in 72 hours . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
&quot; as a pe@@ p@@ tide , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is expected to pass a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid parts with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool . &quot;
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ in .
elimination takes place in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a process of first order with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; based on the conventional methods of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
the toxic@@ ity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to the 10 @-@ fold of the clinical Ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to out@@ going pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or to process insulin effectively . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter working life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body insulin is not working effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin c@@ ams was observed after six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra have to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit from the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; any change in the thickness of the insulin , the mark ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc de@@ cel@@ eration , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dose or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
switching a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hem@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the influence of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and Reser@@ vation , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ balance can be weakened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are classified according to system organs and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; not known ( frequency based on availability of available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive stress , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is failed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a suit@@ ably trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) , as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver . &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ stimul@@ i the effect occurs faster and the duration of effectiveness is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 , insulin therapy in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin L@@ ul@@ ins have a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved just like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was sc@@ rub@@ bed , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was reached . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the meal starts , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved just like with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ ins for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 Min . ) before the meal ( Figure 1A ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ mal mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
