<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the fusion tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are eliminated equally as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this interferes with the transmission of signal between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that aripiprazole, such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, works to a lesser extent than neurotransmitters to activate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, which prevents recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies over a period of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared with a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest by the Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbed to the fusion tablets and the solution to assimilate (assimilated).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in reducing symptoms than those receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to restore manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15mg doses were also less effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled cracking), vomiting (drowsiness), vomiting (drowsiness), vomiting (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazl, were outweighed against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the board came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a licence for the transfer of Abilify throughout the European Union to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients showing predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from combination therapy, the Aria prazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and mood disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, over-line disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriac and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of Dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia have been treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>

<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blockers, decreases the absorption rate of Aria prazole, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole results in comparison with CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common administration of etoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazorphan) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between patient populations under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK increases (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic medication, and their appearance reported in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdoses with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing since Aripiprazl has a high plasma loss."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTC receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HTC receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in the case of Aria prazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and on the putty."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled trial, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to study meditation was similar in both groups (Aria prazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aria prazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a review effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially or over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy resulted in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>

<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"for example, patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensified insulin therapy may be able to alter the hypoglycaemia-warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change regarding strength, mark (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin analog or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA to insulin-based origin) can cause a change in the dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is necessary during the change to Actrophane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first few weeks or months after the conversion."</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">"before travelling across several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician, as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients after other medications taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">"4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fructose in utero."</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can however be gradually developed: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by oral intake of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape picking, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the maximum dose is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effectiveness is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fission (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on the conventional methods of safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunt), mouth-dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of high-etogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"according to the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of I.V. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"resorption After intravenous administration, an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours."</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional in the whole dose range of 0.390 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"after intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations suggest that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with that measured value measured after once intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"about 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and around 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolization we have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended for the distribution of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C."</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug-friendly ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference doctors").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>

<seg id="2665">"Alpheon manufacturers presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease relied again on more patients than with the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test conducted in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected inmates (cracking or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because it may not work against these kinds of infections."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"altargo can be applied for patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should re-examine the patient and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cluttered after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that altargo in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA is not effective enough."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo outweigh the risk of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Ltd. a licence for the launch of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salve, the treatment should be stopped, the ointment is carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials involving secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous treatment of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations in humans following topical application (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment increased by 81% on skimmed skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adaptations are not held if topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are insufficient regarding a statement on effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"during pregnancy, Retapamulin ointment should be applied only if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of delivery, which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"function Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the active mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances."</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide dyldron, blocking partial P-binding adjustment and preventing the normal formation of active 50 ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin may seem questionable at at least some infection forms, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on skulled skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>

<seg id="2709">"Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>

<seg id="2724">"Ambimatrix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, however, Ambimatrix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses may lead to an end."</seg>

<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can defend itself against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambimatrix contains the same components as the vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"because Ambimatrix and Twinrix contain grown-up ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambimatrix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambida led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient atmosphere in a six-month and a 12-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambimatrix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambimatrix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>

<seg id="2745">"in hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, under certain circumstances, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody level is achieved so that in these cases the administration of other vaccines may be necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in case of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, however, Ambimatrix may be injected subcutaneously, as there can be bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration."</seg>

<seg id="2819">"patients with an arginine osuccinatal synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the development of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach."</seg>
<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyl rate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>

<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred with a 5 month old infant with an inadvertent single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or to process insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter working life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body insulin is not working effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin cams was observed after six months."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra have to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit from the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for placing Apidra in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change in the thickness of the insulin, the mark (normal, NPH, zinc deceleration, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dose or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, hemylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the influence of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reservation, the symptoms of adrenergic counterbalance can be weakened or absent."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin lulisin enters into human mother's milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed below are classified according to system organs and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; not known (frequency based on availability of available data)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"if lipoystrophy is failed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, a lipoystrophy can occur at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a suitably trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat), as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver."</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-stimuli the effect occurs faster and the duration of effectiveness is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50, insulin therapy in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosescing effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin Lulins have a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosescing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is achieved just like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
