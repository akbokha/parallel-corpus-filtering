&quot; to translate the module website , you will find in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; translate the menu under Extras website . select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated to the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations do not make important decisions depending on the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can paste text into translation directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , making them available easier . &quot;
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions ... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Extras . then you can view the page , which has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash or delete the list of crashes if available . &quot;
&quot; the module &quot; &quot; view filter &quot; &quot; ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Pre@@ view Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to filter the current working directory in a variety of ways . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : DVI element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects using the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; B &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily detected if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap depic@@ tion is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for the slight detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property like Name , Ow@@ ner , Group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . frames are drawn to show the ne@@ sted entries , and this framework will need space which will then no longer be available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through framework , so that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on an area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; you can find the Picture Gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery window , a dialog opens , allowing you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Images per line has a slider and a revol@@ ving box to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image check box , specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; by viewing the fil@@ esi@@ ze of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , save in HTML file , where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; to include sub@@ folders , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rot@@ ator , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy the original images to the gallery , see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the Com@@ posting box comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the navig@@ ator can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; view menu under the navigation pane or with the key F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add to which you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fier for single domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identification of these outdated browsers .
&quot; with this option , the set browser recognition will be used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
&quot; by using the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used , and the operating system in the individual . &quot;
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Extras website . you can make the following checks :

&quot; the module Web @-@ Archi@@ ver is Copyright &amp; copy ; 2001 @-@ 2003 Andreas Schl@@ ap@@ bach , Antonio Lar@@ os@@ sa and Mal@@ te Star@@ os@@ tik S@@ p@@ b@@ ch @ i@@ am@@ .@@ uni@@ be@@ .@@ ch lar@@ os@@ sa @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , they should report problems and opportunities for improvement . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue with a underlined link . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot;
&quot; it is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list however English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage where news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; if you want &amp; digi@@ kam ; first of all , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data log is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will also be used as an al@@ um@@ library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , which contains pictures , as a base folder . no image is changed . during browsing the folder , you will see a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is in a hidden folder . you can do this by placing a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ kam . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu . &quot;
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Set@@ ting and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ came ; uses the g@@ photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine . as photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the ext@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to drag thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; you can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree tree , over the horizontal release line or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this is shown in the symbol view . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select to edit the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
&quot; the el@@ dest , average , New Year &apos;s buttons : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be swal@@ lowed .
&quot; the collection includes all the photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview . what information these are , you can change the settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails have help window , which appears . if you let the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor take a moment over an image . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window . &quot;
&quot; photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in the way it suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between the view of the images , a slide show or the editing of the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the right mouse button , selecting Edit ... . in the editing section you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view and change your photos . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the open menu . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview , and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved into the bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ dep@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . as a result , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word list , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new key@@ word after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word will be the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . &quot;
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the key@@ word in the contex@@ tual menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want with a key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word . alternatively , you can also click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and assign it to the key@@ word contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo will display as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the tags assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; encomp@@ ass all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ end he search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search matches . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you select Edit , the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you select As extended search , the advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search . here are more rules for searching for . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are linked line @-@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , K@@ eine ... or At least ... you can create . &quot;
&quot; this enables images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . by clicking a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the matching images . also here a thres@@ holds can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can move in or out manually with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illuminated table from the context menu . the selection is added to the illuminated table and its window is opened .
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare , drag it to the left or right side of the window and place it there . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited for sorting out from a picture series . if you use combination @-@ wise to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the area to the same . the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal fire actions also work directly from the lighting table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ controller under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos , scans or stores digital photos , performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , group@@ ing , backup , backup , group@@ ing , backup , backup , and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Manager takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , re@@ forms , conf@@ ec@@ es and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you definitely need to save a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you maintain something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files match together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data is written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos with the further work . &quot;
&quot; let us now use keywords , keywords , as you frequently call in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from a different source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ plug will automatically create the tree for you or use the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let most of you see your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dreaming , have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are going to understand . &quot;
it is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) . you can even place it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell chec@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now moves with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be even more deeply moving in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel using images with geographic information . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author Top@@ ic : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; the publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright passages , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , problems with the so @-@ called New Media are concerned . &quot;
&quot; Kro@@ ll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVD , &amp; Dollar ; 2 piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD Cap@@ ture Devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but they write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB , thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . you can also read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks on this subject : disk error study &quot;
&quot; the failure rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT can &apos;t detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT are the most common error reason . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not matter much , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy storage and grounded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . however , remember that not every connector strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should be aware that it fulfil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should pay attention to the fact that all peripher@@ als connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers also manufacture over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it may be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system . some models will allow them to continue working until the current runs . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to euro ; 20 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V you can pay for less than 1 euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB of cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are desktop @-@ safe . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have one day to open a photo and this to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ruption within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a low level and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its own file system , which is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ station systems . for lap@@ tops , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limitations . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather wor@@ sens . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; if , then one day , a flash hit you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget aircraft incidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time where such backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you need to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way than to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should be answered already based on the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of disk if necessary
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . however , it can store much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is capable of storing gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved colour allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF was widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the needs of the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and inde@@ b@@ ted to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some point .
&quot; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , en@@ code m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , connect them to your computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras it can take a while . when the connection is established , a fer@@ ous indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not yet been digi@@ tised by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons all download or use Sel@@ ected , a dialog with which you can select the target album appears in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed as usual folder . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you just want to delete a few , you must select it first and then delete selected del@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore pictures that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check whether the photos were downloaded successfully in a &amp; edited album before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should do this about the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as file names for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the file names are normally re@@ used once the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it may be useful to incorporate the date and time on which the image was made into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; during the transfer , three more options will be created before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto@@ graph section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % t % H : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you will have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which has been digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and used automatically when you next time open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; all cameras provide this information . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it leaves &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Autom@@ atic Rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually disabled , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the Date Filter option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; node ; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the location data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must store these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
&quot; there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in order to access these settings , you need to change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you have to change the Settings menu in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . note if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s profession . this may be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author if this works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; image descriptions as embedded labelling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows you to read your cap@@ tions also from other picture viewers . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter appears in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the light from &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , each time you open the light table , these settings are not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select them here . you can disable the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files , you can comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setup , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was just an image viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd rows , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option marks the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . this option is ignored for other cameras .
&quot; the default is the pointed lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as it displays the setting through white in the settings . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , as blue pixels are generally not sati@@ ated as quickly as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ v therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ising algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as a CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ization Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ w . however , it generates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for colour sof@@ tening as you are carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . to translate information like the color information from a color space to the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you save all your profiles . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; Standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened . &quot;
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ less not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color @-@ tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ v G@@ amma does not fix for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given by a device . this is very useful before you print picture , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not in the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon section extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam , many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu , under settings &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera features appear on the left @-@ hand side a list of all the supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you must enter here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; confirmation dialog &quot; &quot; option for moving &gt; view images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es of &amp; digi@@ kam . in the del@@ eting of a photos and del@@ eting an album , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes made by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also include the display of the Welcome Frame from &amp; digi@@ kam , to stop at startup . this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the setting When Start search for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tes ; searches the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; it can be used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview , and selecting the entry / edit entry . &quot;
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . you may not be part of your distribution .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , displaying file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions for image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before saving a file or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rec@@ over from the File menu or use the button Rec@@ over of image processing again in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saving . &quot;
virtually every action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can undo you by modi@@ fying and restoring edit by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; Shift Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full@@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come in the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can view this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam page . see the section for setting up image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select the Ex@@ ports Ex@@ porting Wiz@@ ard from the menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it will appear when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you chose a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tings . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word used previously . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom of the screen is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you wish to add a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - dates , key@@ word and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used on the right , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is on K@@ a keywords , which reduces the quantity to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it would be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options will then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web / Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that you have from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to colour management , everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information enable you to make informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flows meet all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other picture editions are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another colour space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , as s@@ RGB outputs the circle . if you are working on s@@ RGB , you either need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , balance , Autom@@ atic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Autom@@ atic correction attempt automatically from your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot can be changed as bri@@ ghtly as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the compar@@ isons very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range , and a re @-@ ji@@ bing of all values in between . &quot;
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if so far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adju@@ ster lets you improve or also di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it into a text file and load later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles allows you to consult chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under color sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , allowing you to use it for several photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , darker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar process . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a coloured film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are too much for a few phot@@ ograph@@ ers especially those who have hardly any landscapes .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color extracts of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
&quot; in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the instrument sound value correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic arrangement is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the bottom for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shades , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modify channel : this box allows you to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode is the most sensible . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a curve to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output strings and that the associated image pixels become darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you post@@ p@@ one this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
&quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ er channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can choose the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right bottom : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components , as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating magnificent black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour space consists of small noise acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of its abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore like the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm , bright and medium tones while adding a bit of col@@ dness to the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of remaining a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ qui@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your picture . going through the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ y surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock @-@ on effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio previously used . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simply a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; use tool template you can place a template using a picture .
the Picture Tem@@ plate menu apply in image processing can be used to place templates on a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears , which mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ness is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask is working on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it rather works psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focuss@@ ing is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to combine colors with minimal differences to one color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink spots are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used in internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a focus filter already while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the focus on sharpen@@ ing . this can be done using the menu item &quot; &quot; Cor@@ rect sharp@@ ness &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen a picture can re@@ focus the tool . in general , you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry Cor@@ rect sof@@ ten@@ er and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool for removing v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the filter output with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fy the effect . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from the sharp@@ ness and therefore avoided beauty errors in faces , cel@@ esti@@ al and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ urred mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focuss@@ ing a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted distortion filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . re@@ focuss@@ ing usually achieves better results than bl@@ urred .
&quot; in practice , circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss @-@ fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are very rare . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate . it is most often caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you modify the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will subsequently leave incomplete arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ urred mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the bl@@ urred mas@@ king to use a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter , it is always possible to show that it is the optimum Line@@ ar Filter . the results of the F@@ IR Vienna filter are always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of sharp@@ shooting in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ s the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want to see blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Ri@@ der smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be subsequently necessary . &quot;
&quot; direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a movie grain or CCD rus@@ hes will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG Tri@@ art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm will go through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . if any image error settings can be corrected , it can be saved into a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced settings can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is required per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . put it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ ar tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more intoxic@@ ated , but also conce@@ als the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high to s@@ me@@ ar . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to shar@@ pen a soft sign with the menu item &quot; &quot; Con@@ duc@@ er plas@@ tici@@ zing &quot; &quot; and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter to restore gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , movie grain , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that is recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ table method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly after connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
&quot; average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ i ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filters , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter time in circumstances such that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise im@@ shar@@ pen effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ and the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ rank filter by using an equivalent transformation on a picture without this filter . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three other controls the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which causes an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or acci@@ dentally a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam page ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ effici@@ ents fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second density . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth density . this value is stronger at the edges than in the center of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and results in a correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the tone or cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes . ideally , perform this correction as all first . if you cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to display the dotted lines . move the mouse poin@@ ter to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ e- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Trans@@ forming trim from image processing or via the Zoom controller to remove this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives like shots from front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ web@@ u.@@ org web site which is achiev@@ able under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO Regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photographs , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers are mixing large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the movie bas@@ king effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing checks the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side looked at , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the work@@ piece is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients are slowly changing , therefore not ideal for this effect . it would be helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen for you to start sket@@ ching . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top knob sel@@ ects the pin size , and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon labelling filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ came ; filter Grav@@ ur shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
&quot; shaft blocks 2 : analog to shaft blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines starting from a central point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a spinning camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
&quot; movement sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ est sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by random displacement of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color basin in the picture and bl@@ urs them without alter@@ ing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . so you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural to your images a wet appearance . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep the range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the drop @-@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can find it by mirrors or rotating in the right direction . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ forming turning or transforming mirrors . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and sharp the details ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how to retrieve the missing information or guess it ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size modi@@ fies a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with better quality , then try to blow up the tool . &quot;
&quot; many picture editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . enlarge each single entry for photo , can be saved as text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put an image together . to cut a photo you simply have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply clicking with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the blank , use the button The cutting button for image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the choice relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the blan@@ king tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the projected image and not the original image . &quot;
the setup help settings allow help to fade out so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden centre is a division based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational figure 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the gold center provides liquid relief lines if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will give you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ hand rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal Options mirror and mirror vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things rotate around an angle . you can fix this with the camera ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select it Trans@@ forming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after turning . please note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right edge of the trans@@ formed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . &quot;
&quot; the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal line , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . &quot;
&quot; you can sh@@ ears horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ oring tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots produce twice as much understanding and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the finish , the picture has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way those libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot;
&quot; this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam , you can change this list of file extensions . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when indicated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can use Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF using the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ came ; supports loading raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ v , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are frequently saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . however , it is not a movie editor and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam . their description follows here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture Application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected thumb@@ nail area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the filter in the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can move in or out manually with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and la@@ stly used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is activated under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end sign , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; included , are outdated according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph@@ ene in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and displays in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or graphs in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in one &amp; kate ; -@@ component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these knots )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graphs . it is needed in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot file , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in a file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or want to present the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but it can also be modified with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can re @-@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph that come on a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Re @-@ store page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( re@@ charge automatically or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask each time . &quot;
&quot; the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) , or determine that each time is requested . &quot;
the session management page gives you the option to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked every time you start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up other possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
&quot; it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom , or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm produces a spring@@ board layout for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the node in circular shape according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( judged or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed and ne@@ ato ; for fl@@ eri@@ ed graphs ) .
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI with this mouse cur@@ sor ; element to get more help to this element ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module reads pictures to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the standard source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by selecting the default duc@@ ts default values to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan with the scanning button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings might not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button Scan@@ nen , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Im@@ por@@ table &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog appears options of the target image with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management online . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you are using the module for the first time , you are run by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so , it &apos;s just your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to allow you to log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you click Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module extern@@ ally is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at the moment , you do not need any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , you can upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server . &quot;
&quot; the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words , which are added to the image as keywords during the upload . &quot;
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates into the metadata of an image . the geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image , and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can combine a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to provide a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera period must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera height . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you have no track data from one location for pictures , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add it to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog changes the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can be manually selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ hibition tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which should be exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the tab allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all of your associated images . select a folder from which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . naturally , it also influences file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; thumb@@ nail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to Canc@@ el the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom or displacement . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality and metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increasing , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the module MPEG enco@@ der can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Extras . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under picture files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be adjusted next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the film with the encoding knob . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a cup of coffee quickly or in calm@@ ness , when you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that code or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings right below . &quot;
the printer Wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ v by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ v to generate the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ v ! &quot;
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG counter does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it further , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : non@@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent . further images can be drawn to the list of images to be sent and put there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . a preview on the right is displayed for the last selected image . &quot;
you can also drag images to the list of images and drop them to the list of images to be sent .
the button pictures remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachment .
most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments on the images are added to a text file and sent to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted for los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG among images file format and the original files in JPEG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so that you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically launched in the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
&quot; there are over a dozen transition effects , between which you can choose . by chance , each transition between the images chooses another effect . &quot;
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse and photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you click the mouse on the entry characters , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; with this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however for each person , save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the names , select the button on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t own suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you will need to select which picture to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to select the Image Gallery window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the setting of the image properties . you can view this dialog at once . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can either be a part of the total file , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images by specific names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name suggests this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database .
&quot; each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will appear in the preview button ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button pressed and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only drag images of that time in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following section of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the overview and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select to see if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . learn more about the export files in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed by the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . for example , that all pictures are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not addressed specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who watch your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all of your HTML files , select a root folder and set a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all of your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and next time automatically added . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . so the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the just described settings are related to all three of the basic folder and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to share your pictures with these . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them to your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a two @-@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are placed in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access via the Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether internal or external .@@ k@@ im files should act . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when the manual is placed near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automati@@ cally near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want to do so , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) capture the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , pictures are talked about , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS . &quot;
&quot; if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then you can start a different folder tree with images , you can download &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained to you . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also define your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the list box , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I , meaning &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . more information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules are shared by several applications among themselves , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications use their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , it will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do if you would have selected persons to view and pass this on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can search your picture database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons depicted on the image , where the image was taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved upwards , to find and classi@@ fy persons . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may still want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click the pre and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail preview . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry in a category and drop it there to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and post@@ p@@ one the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you have no filter . an example of this you can see here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the preview preview . just select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Del@@ ete key in the Edit menu . now the window will be shown that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images somewhere , that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . for example , the images 1 @-@ 9 are available . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so that you can preview these images . however , you cannot view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid trouble as you want to avoid confusion about your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those left you want to make accessible to others and click Current View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also choose all the images that your little sister is allowed to see , control and lock the menu item all out of current view . &quot;
&quot; you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , allowing all the pictures you have locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to rep@@ el the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours for hours with it is of course , that you want to view it at some point . for this reason , it has a photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the image , but additional information that you have to enter via the image , such as who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and finish . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . then download a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom out , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out the plus key zo@@ oming in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom angle is highlighted and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the DC key sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that are in and out , are using the plus and minus key . &quot;
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which pictures you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have set features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . this can be seen in the browser . so if you want to edit all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after selecting the image . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later . &quot;
&quot; to switch the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; click on the picture from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object already selected , as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need B &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visibility level selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the sh@@ utter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views overl@@ apping each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map icon at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the An@@ f@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left at the top bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window arrangement ... save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon , the icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes as you like , from a quick preview up to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; render settings &quot; &quot; icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu ... the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
in combination quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user retro @-@ lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature better look out . &quot;
&quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; and P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive , recur@@ sively , because each pixel is continuously split and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ess depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card you can specify whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . then , a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the menu item file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document retention and the version . the versions are supported 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. al@@ ti@@ tudes ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder &apos;s folder , you must also add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the objects shown , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wireless model views are further divided if the camera is using an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you display a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor is rendered below the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tick channel smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . you can find more detailed information about parameters in the R@@ ender modes section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window arrangements , explains how to create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the drop down sel@@ ector Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , using a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should pay attention to the following warnings , before you complain that as a result you will only receive a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything correctly installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wi@@ re@@ model view ( bottom right ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the App@@ ly button or the input button , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert final body qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the application or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now also indicates the level , even at the moment only as fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor , if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can choose how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property tree ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the preview button , you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pig@@ ments . so , always remember that you can check the color of the materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on a header or a ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then enter the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ders your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each time and change the colors in the object &apos;s view : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have understood the basic method of working by &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or button application ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you shifted the floor around one unit to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the following step , place a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection have already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal is not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the Ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last undo command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used Edit Rück@@ undo .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; here you can change the look , key short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can modify , modify , or add new commands with this option . &quot;
opens a dialog for setting up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er using this option .
&quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface , without changing the geometric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a B@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis , using an image file as a color chart . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very easy . the File browser lists files you can click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can specify whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in Dialog - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set up the working of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ art . in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ok@@ it@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ok@@ it@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that can display the program as well . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider and the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; set the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider and the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image decreases by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ fic show ; is also closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photograph ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to this , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photograph , then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ photograph ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you should be able to answer questions about other users soon . &quot;
the best start to join &amp; show@@ photograph ; to join the developer mailing list is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&quot; in order to access these settings , you need to change the behavior of &amp; show@@ picture ; settings . to access these settings , you need to set the settings show@@ foto and set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photograph ; has a side bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sc@@ anned ; is an application to scan images that do not more than scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images , which can no longer be used as images and save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE website by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; with the command , sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed driver options . &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom so that the complete preview fits in the window . &quot;
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialogue of the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type as &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; image stores image stores . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ rap@@ l@@ ite ; it should be saved automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save As option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it using the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; sc@@ rap@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; to end .
&quot; &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs button short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut table can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting global key short@@ cuts . selecting the right mouse button in the player window and selecting short commands ... Select .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts , so make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all the modules you need are present and use a dialog , so the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you &apos;ll quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . usually , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Run the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , every script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok put the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is allu@@ ded to . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to remove one entry one uses d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ca script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . you might just search for a specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . for details , see the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activate Deb@@ u@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be arranged without difficulty via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; in addition to the Player window , the player window will turn to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window will only be displayed . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ able . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; format : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ able . this will change the color scheme used for the m@@ ood@@ le bar@@ ometer . &quot;
disc@@ ard files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ able . if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ able / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ date part of the piece change , ensures that the playlist window is open / un@@ rolled to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is allu@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can choose the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn fon@@ ts the otherwise gray section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , Player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can design@@ ate your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated , for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will automatically continue playing with the piece at the point with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; set up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when you use on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if sel@@ e colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate additional settings in this card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which should be searched for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search both the requested and their sub@@ folders for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. add or delete music files ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setting is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : the host is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the board map last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send completed pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile , to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will for example support difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
&quot; most of the time , that is because tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate ATM when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens on a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be followed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
most installation problems are best clari@@ fied by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please carry only one error there if you are interested in fixing a fault in Amar@@ ok itself .
after starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there now ?
&quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side , and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start menu has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column display . you can also use the Quick commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select From Play@@ list to remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop it down there , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config utility . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . in addition you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be Wel@@ che media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 deco@@ ders in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input t@@ ass@@ el &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in the search for the problem matter and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may have to specify another sign ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do not forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t simply send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS will also de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia entirely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the test register to register all the Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - Download f@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer . then delete all the f@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm command this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you are arous@@ ed by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button represents a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what about the icon in the Control bar section ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . to the normal reading switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more the play has been played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then , you can change the valuation of a piece as well as all other attributes , by right @-@ clicking on the piece , or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that does not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this under Amar@@ ok .... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design ... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok , while browsing the kon@@ quer@@ or . then start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the drop down menu add Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
audio @-@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and password . audio @-@ cro@@ pl@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please read the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you must now install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ l , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ l . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound@@ card with Amar@@ ok ?
&quot; set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Output the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib looks after the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this issue by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very easy . drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it by using the button of the playlist , and you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please choose Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the playback knob . &quot;
the audio CD feature uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just right click on one entry and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you will need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like every normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok has multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream currently running . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; below the scroll bar , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also available . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . as soon as you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that there is no other player . however , don &apos;t let the wealth of functions frigh@@ ten you , they &apos;re all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation zone . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser shows various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window will have gone away . the information presented there are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . additionally , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . underneath you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in order to display cover images in context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , the artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is needed .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Artist / Album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to the performer , and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list of different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Artist / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - alb@@ um@@ name is used . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and by interpretation .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you have something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the search filter contains a selection box , with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select various time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you get the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ vers the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces from the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you reach the same effect .
&quot; set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue , so you will be played next . &quot;
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this artist burn / burn to CD - so the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) move files to the garbage bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; undo / change a compilation @-@ marked album back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; also , even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog for creating a new Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( eg . iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar contains a search area where you can search for a file . the search is useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list , all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar , with which you can pick music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and press input button , you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to mount files by simple drop @-@ down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be useful : this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all items attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter there letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed , until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter separated search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the commentary bad .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the order of the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left @-@ hand side , you will find the Add button with which you can add the playlist pieces . &quot;
&quot; next , follow the undo and restore buttons . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be selected with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu , you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and setup tool@@ bars ... Select . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover @-@ management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . &quot;
&quot; after you have set a piece into the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details for setting up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m Rec@@ ommen@@ dations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select drawers . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing right away . the playlist &apos;s Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New Ref@@ res@@ h button completes the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the respective settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will no longer hear it in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed , taking into account the setting of pla@@ ited pieces . &quot;
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set here more than 1 , then the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts let you customize settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . in order to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , remember that when re@@ coding to MP3 , you will get worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . wait until the machine has completed the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy the CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to burn the data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news on community aid . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , chooses &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; typically automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio deco@@ ded . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to convert them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and Super Video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will play differently loud . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is shown by selecting folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file save .
&quot; if a project is changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . besides , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project not saved , just as if you would have called for each project file Cl@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you &apos;ll be asked what to do with it , as if you would have called a file Cl@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Bren@@ nen , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . it is useful for you to view files for a multi @-@ session CD .
&quot; this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows the copying of a CD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows the copying of a DVD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later on . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD using the copy dialogue , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even ways to modify the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drive . if the content view is activated , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view enables the selection and dra@@ gging of files into the projection screen . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided that a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard layout to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the proper per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the system administrator &apos;s password when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications too , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task is crucial , which gives you a preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String , Q@@ String , Q@@ String ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , simply audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders enco@@ ded these wa@@ v files by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats , such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while the setup needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog is often called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , all of which is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the Con@@ figuration Settings tab in the setup code - the encoding .
&quot; a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of enco@@ ders available so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before , the enco@@ der in the code settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and coding . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as logs , p@@ olls ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; terminated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you select the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( for high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually be acceptable for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the software automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) when encoding MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the -@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself . it is to be noted that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : that is the author ) I am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information can be caused by a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( this can only be the program@@ mer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed by the concerned lin@@ ux distribution , before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders are in the Di@@ ver chapter . &quot;
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this may have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading rights and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory consists of and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something that is probably done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if there is more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map chart General settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is set / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only if you select incomplete information , you will be informed if information about generating key@@ word ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the machine must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB in size , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; simultaneously reading and coding : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? &quot;
CD ; ej@@ ection after reading the last piece : cross it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of concur@@ rent WAV files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was written in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with success@@ full of fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only happens when the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , check the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments on a single piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words are beginning with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . &quot;
&quot; you can change tag information of the created files later any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read CD . in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BO@@ M list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks that are marked so are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or select the button All items at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the selection process by clicking on the button selection , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error if you are trying to work with a code you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example . do you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error oc@@ cured directly after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . this takes place reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in the case of high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to people compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it will continue from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you succeeded in retri@@ eving the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke Player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colors , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of each MIDI channel activity by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text events ) . k@@ mid estimates automatically the procedure used .
&quot; support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid windows ; this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid windows . ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after another . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playing speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the tempo LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so you do not need to manually set up the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select Settings menu item from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section , you &apos;ll see how you can use your collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the Collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired ones in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the Pre@@ vious piece , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map automatically transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the necessary re@@ play for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as you wish . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
&quot; in this section , you specify how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shooting ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shooting . &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the term &quot; &quot; drum @-@ patch &quot; &quot; refers to a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; key@@ maps are mainly used to make sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see , for example , the provided key@@ maps . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , simply do this in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can , for example , be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if therefore a MIDI file sends a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM suggests that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos , you see which sounds are played right now . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t g@@ lean more green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu below the channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before that , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a MIDI file ) or plu@@ gged in ( when I play a MIDI file ) or plu@@ gged into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn on automatic addition to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid . first , you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this inspir@@ es me to write on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ se@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I am studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I am trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file . &quot;
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I would like to emphasize that I &apos;m more program@@ mer because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , bug reports or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music of course . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter problems , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and Camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links below the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; S@@ ME / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , then select the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation for starting and closing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ session option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can therefore quit the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g ; / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the &amp; KM@@ player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool bar of KM@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of mp@@ layer visi@@ bly .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&quot; flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , this must be done by modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should reproduce all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; it can be played by TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device and the TV channels . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog is to be used in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; it uses dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more silent if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root to execute the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom will show on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts slowly but why does each time my CPU have to be checked for performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ st . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the GNU / Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone , regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users should hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; website . &quot;
&quot; if questions arise regarding comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed on the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within that a simple , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to experience its possibilities the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; as well as other mark@@ up languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ program class , the Cologne begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this displays the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; Report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
encoding : with this the code encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 coding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be washed ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Let@@ ter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it now . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; you should notice a simple problem search anyway . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic completion of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) , a blank line ( for typing the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command will be created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; if the document is divided into the following elements ( part , the highest and sub@@ paragraph is the bottom element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rendered independent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; has been created , jump &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is , in addition to PDF , the original output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when searching , the elements of the DVI file are plu@@ cked with the editor and as soon as it was cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI file , the corresponding section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source text was cli@@ cked , becomes the corresponding passage in DVI ; viewer jumped . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . in the use of a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings . &quot;
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the other hand , can be &quot; &quot; over@@ grown &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick input of common elements into the document . the first drop down box is for rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box Fur@@ ther is to add items such as keywords , gaps or references . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a term for a section , an image or another element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection above a selection field possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; it works only if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ e &quot; &quot; is used for determining the font sizes . the font sizes for the main text , the Fu@@ el notes etc. can be specified . there are the following font sizes available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two options are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and defining the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font sizes are not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the menu of construction or the push of a button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; stores the storage automatically .
&quot; if comp@@ iling the document fails , you should search for errors when logging in . if this is not the case , the logging should be followed automatically . &quot;
&quot; an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then increase the change of font sizes within the environment . &quot;
changes are only corrected within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } up to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least one quote , a few places in bold and cur@@ sive printing and a poem should be used to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability from some of the drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are needed for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed with a file print ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview search opens the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern settings must be set up under Settings box ... &quot;
&quot; to execute the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source code and must be cli@@ cked on forward search . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and entered to the corresponding line . for this purpose &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( Set@@ ting the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using the fast @-@ building of the &amp; DVI viewer , there may be errors . if an error is present , this will be summ@@ ed up in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file tells the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the bu@@ ds can be cli@@ cked on the La@@ Te@@ X error and the La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between the errors . the log file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong row . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document may either be re@@ written or used to quickly create a new document . for more information , refer to the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced with other data ( e.g. name or code coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... Settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as following : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be searched .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; uses &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability to read and highlight many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn his possibilities , the manual to Kate should be attracted to . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start up there directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex , and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the differences differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
many assistants can add additional ho@@ cks . this is a separate type of bookmark within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ rs Edi@@ ting marks or the respective key @-@ keys possibly reach the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . this is also highlighted with this jump @-@ mark so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent possibilities offered , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code added ; select the following commands for selecting text : &quot;
&quot; this extended mean@@ ings include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also applies &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it is possible to remove it first and remove it by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for faster ability . under Edit Rem@@ ove , the following commands are included to delete the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands in Edi@@ ting environment for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surrounding } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands you can quickly lose view of the environment . this command completes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group , a few important commands that match those from editing environments . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jumped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted , welded groups @-@ brackets you can quickly lose overview . this command closes the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple indications are used as G@@ Ã ¼ r . for expe@@ dient implementation , the sign &quot; &quot; used &quot; &quot; is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple indications . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and applies two conclu@@ ding references for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ein . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double check mark can be set up under settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use language specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when shr@@ inking Shift ; En@@ ter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , complete the line with \ \ \ \ with a complete line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange columns in tables -@@ surroundings and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . while pushing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above row , add some spac@@ ing for the columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , it has been added for various modes . all these modes can be configured for different modes of operation under the box ... fully adjusted . &quot;
at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when clicking the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and incor@@ rectly editing the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are selected by &amp; Ki@@ le ; alternatively , jump handles can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by modi@@ fying boun@@ cing marks , and the selected parameters can then be captured . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; fully customiz@@ able , settings can be made to these lists . there can be different roll lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as accounts of general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the completion mode will result in a large number of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environment . &quot;
&quot; when called Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the environment failure can be continued in the easiest way and terminated by clicking the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognis@@ es that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be executed . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; fully customiz@@ able , settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of failure mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by foreign strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le is used , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word &quot; &quot; Complete &quot; &quot; is initiated , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large number of W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are not helpful for automatic failure . however , it has been found that many users in a document are written more than once . this provides &amp; Ki@@ le ; the failure for all already written guides . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the settings box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled fully . here , also the threshold value for displaying the failure rate can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the corrupt files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the graphic display dialog shapes the input of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ ordering pages . if the PDF output is edited , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ Tools and then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are grouped together in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file by Alt ; 4 and the PS file can be viewed via Alt ; 4 . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project is about the project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when you exit the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script co@@ de . the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first you have to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; supplied with many documents . this includes documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete User manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ verses ; the small application tex@@ doc @-@ k , which contains a database with all documents and here for a graphical surface area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le , then only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or using the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X. &quot;

&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day you use therefore different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste in the bottom section your new signature ; save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file save or click the flo@@ ppy icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; all found templates are listed here . it must be noted that the Export Rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T are valid . therefore , multiple templates can be present with the same agreement and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a cardboard card in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g inspec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as under@@ lay . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows ba@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a bit , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the desired folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time i pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical surface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , you can simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is incorrect . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply changed . if not , delete the current file with the check box and select the file to be checked by means of other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result is to have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing the plug @-@ in plugin . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all of the plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often in one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniquely identify .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and selecting the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears gre@@ asy according to which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information to be created to the team leaders if something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project settings dialog dialo@@ ges , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to input comments is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the first name of the team member is , play a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader , Sub@@ project Manager , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive regardless of case @-@ sensitive but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the following : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that supports DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with each other .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; / lo@@ wer@@ case sensitivity of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags close : if requested , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; actu@@ alize start and end tag automatically : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button the standard specifications can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) .
&quot; default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so in case of a power failure or crash when the next startup of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor field or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface has been changed by changing M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message field is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
&quot; the location for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the realm of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree in the edit and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause ab@@ dic@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third party that can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
un@@ load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus tells you if the entered information is correct . selecting allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment but it should be installed later .
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin was implemented that enables different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot;
a view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or a part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ g Session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ex@@ its the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is given , the execution continues . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script , and if possible in functions and include it is corrected . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there was not the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag directory and the tool@@ bar ; tag files contain two file types , file &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool lists are handy , symbolic frames of image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted faster in a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialo@@ ges which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bars enable a fast insert of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing as folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the description language and version . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has an common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; this element can only occur once for each attribute , it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag grouped together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; empty spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; function &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Alter DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = Ver@@ sol@@ ation 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current key short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus lets you find the script in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables which can be used in the command line :
&quot; % f : we replace the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot;
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined what to send to the standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the default output . it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
&quot; fill in all necessary fields , and add the tag to the right tool bar . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size Other . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually displayed as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will be a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in root folders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their file list ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might be in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but watch &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to design context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context help , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the contex@@ tual list and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separate context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily , after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the missed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else . in different places there is an email send menu , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , ship tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useless for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource pass the input fields ( URL pre@@ views can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menu DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and sign@@ aling . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the day XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D loading and conversion of DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the division is divided into three areas : global , locally and projected . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all map Le@@ aders , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , skip to a book@@ marking or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor section will result in a further context menu on the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cur@@ sor , or open the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open it and to ro@@ am . in the display with card @-@ ri@@ bs are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by means of right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available ; local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project .
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended project @-@ specific documentation , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop@@ len , what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sh@@ elling so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Ch@@ en@@ rol@@ ment , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
on and off the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of a mouse .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Pre@@ vious and Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
displays a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; search the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it only creates the name . actions must be saved using settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu default in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
&quot; currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bar , is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed below the above menu points . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax indicator mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes takes time or create unpleasant graphic . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window resp@@ . off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
speci@@ fies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; see details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the best from top to bottom , because , for example , after filling up the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ de@@ .@@ de@@ . ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started anew from the ground up , do not hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can select a fine selection of good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the hook , clips from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . in the menu with project properties , these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Pro@@ files or changed to Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the Project Wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; now only G@@ ub@@ ed can be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ files window , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by using its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as defined by a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration dialog one can turn event actions and add , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as viewing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at this moment . &quot;
to open a different project choose project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the Di@@ alogue Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
&quot; folders beha@@ ved as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option will not be questioned .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ profile sections can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simple exchange of views , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted via Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar from the Project or Project tool@@ bar menu . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best viewed using the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool boxes is treated below in the Ad@@ ding tool bar section . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a New tool@@ bar can be created , the tool bar can be renamed or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings for actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are usually found in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl based . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File to save As local template . &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or insert via the Con@@ quer@@ or fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder to the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can provide head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder is set up , it would de@@ activate templates in this path in principle unless they were explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers through copying contents templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which are accessible via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP , there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while the position in the document is retained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source code editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta . selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation : a small span for fast hosts and a big span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties can be selected . this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this is to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows the change of the content such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , because of moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags will not be removed from existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted , surround with text , any other surrounding anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Wiz@@ ard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other styles of style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed .
&quot; to be able to compile and compile successfully , the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , at a point loaded from x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded style template file names with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ fix called QNAP or a specified model name is verified . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP device that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be expanded to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically re@@ checked when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . post@@ ural points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a de@@ bu@@ gging program in X@@ SL style sheets ( X@@ SL = e@@ X@@ tended St@@ yl@@ es@@ he@@ et Language ) . it has similar commands like the Unix / Linux de@@ bu@@ gger g@@ db . there are three ways to execute a style sheet :

&quot; start a shell . then enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g command , command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help . &quot;
adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ X ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation about the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; converts the conversion 20 times , if --@@ repeat two times is specified , the conversion is executed 100 times &quot;
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this has been activated in Lib@@ XML
activate the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document if the support for this has been activated in Lib@@ XML . this is turned on as default .
&quot; on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll to / off with the arrow keys of the commands executed so far . &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument will set a stop in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template that consists only of the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . &quot;
&quot; P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many points . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later any number of other useful functions were added later .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently of each other on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for automatic selection of the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and le@@ aned against the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other one differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; open dialog opens the manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merging or merging of folders is initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . you can specify options before you start comparing / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and drop it over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you &apos;d have to create two corresponding files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) each info line has a different color . ( note that Windows C is too long , allow the mouse to rest over the line for a while . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for pre@@ processor and in rare , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the text output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; enco@@ der &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the sprin@@ kl@@ ets S@@ prin@@ ge to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste it somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate to the left , right , high , down , side , side , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the dispens@@ ing window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the In@@ sert key you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the Con@@ junction and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / last conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down ) or to the next / last un@@ solved conflict . therefore , conflicts must be distinguished between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if enabled , you will automatically copy the option Sel@@ ection automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you may acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart re@@ circulation + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the options and the list of recently used files will automatically be saved while they are loaded and restored at the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 , set up ... ) &quot;
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be shown ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the move of the previous row is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; at the same time , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step , white characters cannot be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complex and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is applied . &quot;
&quot; ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; these options are handled in the chapter for scanning folders and conducting a merge . for details , see documentation for comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language there is globally controlled by the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; on the selection fields for coding , a brief note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files can be compared and merged with different encoding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color enco@@ ded over@@ sight column . however , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will display a second over@@ sight column with the information needed . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply drop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparative window next to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last modified output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the time line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this preview command for line balancing to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generating text $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line balancing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . for example :
&quot; instead of used , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings &apos; in per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceded &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders in recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate the merging and shows the simulated changes without actually performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is very similar to the comparison and merging of single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line , or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders does not start automatically , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that were compared to that are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
each file and every folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the name in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C column . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist or delete the target if it exists )
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot;
&quot; a and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option folders are synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option &quot; &quot; Select File instead of merge &quot; &quot; ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; when merging , one file will be processed after the other . you status column shows finished when the merge operation was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the combination actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the three folder merge mode C is used as the destination , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped by the particular entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries , select / continue in the folder / continue in the menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key element ) . in order to merge only the current entry , select Ac@@ tions of the current element , or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid combination actions , a message appears that indicates the defective items . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Typ@@ ing , Sim@@ ulations and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes , then you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again / continue / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , then a corresponding dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually compiled , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 settings menu ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not need to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; ignored files , which would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set folder specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . ) &quot;
&quot; in some file systems , files have an attribute . in other file systems , a prec@@ ursor points a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links point . this is down@@ lighted in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the links are handled and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible records . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can be useful , for example , if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; activate the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results from merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file as action is suggested . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is provided the knowledge that the other file was not changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible during the merging of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change @-@ of @-@ date . therefore , per@@ missions or change @-@ of @-@ date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently being the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; typically requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; however , two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or adjusting folders is not supported in the part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the program@@ mers who went this way or let him go that way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably do not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are the next to each other , this is the cur@@ is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
&quot; you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing the text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c has left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a &amp; k@@ de system , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries that show differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source using A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both within a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ ware . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; cross this field to the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of the virtual work@@ spaces . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally letting &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , like from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all the virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ Program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . in addition , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... lets dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ .@@ If you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you must enter the key to wind banner mode and assign value to it . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; you can read a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter looks like a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor settings . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to detect the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it using the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop@@ down window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be shown in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button Document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ los@@ ers &amp; etc . &quot;
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen@@ shot . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&quot; it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) , and that every mouse click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and can em@@ ulate pain on the peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . &quot;
&quot; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of your computer may also cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and stops a mouse click as soon as you break the motion .
&quot; the smart shifting activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this dwell time must be st@@ owed after the end of the mouse movement , before the mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; when shifting is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is shut down , the mouse button is waiting until the mouse button takes place . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a slide control sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; first , use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shift should be switched off first . if you are used to automatic click , you can later pack the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mou@@ sec@@ lick is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to remove the mouse h@@ emisphere . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; in this case , if you use the intelligent shift , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can stop by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but leave the mouse on a neutral section of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bar and menu and the front rows of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to select text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : run a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . by doing so , the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mou@@ sec@@ lick . so you know exactly when the shift time starts when smart shifting . later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker and these are correctly set up .
&quot; the program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , causing pain to be pressed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a drawing process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word completion . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , correctly set up , you can enter the sets you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the default memory . you can select from these sets that should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the side of the word and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possibility kt@@ ts@@ d is used as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first , try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . it makes sense to choose this option even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant talk , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and added in addition to the input box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will be entered only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text passages , you can choose to automatically save the text document when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book script will not be saved . select Before Save , you will find &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text message is to be saved . &quot;
the word dictionary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
&quot; with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ mouth ; the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to only insert correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add newly entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected movements of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly below the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a sli@@ dable bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not use the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth , set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the directory / usr / local / festival . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last sign of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
/ usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page that appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can print text through the computer . it is stored a list of already broken pro@@ positions that the user can always re@@ charge . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice synthes@@ izer contains . on the computer a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which enables every application to read text through the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS abilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; posters ; , even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; the speech output is via the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .

&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and correct speech dis@@ pat@@ chers . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ .@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card General will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map icon Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already established actors appear in this list . the preferred actors appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the panel . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can use it almost . go back to the map tab and check if the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can read &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the flash@@ card orders to create and manage text jobs . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab General to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and remove the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr finishes , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; buttons in this series allow you to start , cancel , pause , and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that should be read , and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text from a website . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read text displayed . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that should be read , and select Tools text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when posted ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; note is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you about events specified by you . you can read the text of this news also by &amp; kt@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the &amp; k@@ de I@@ RC program , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item displays noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notification vary depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain fla@@ ws of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ chers &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of text . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed following the issue of warning .
&quot; news is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you read &amp; eg , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every job you get from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for output longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; this output is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions , which allow to replace chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; re@@ formers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML , from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not applicable , it continues to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page . editing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup dialo@@ gs are shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up string replace filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative examples . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ set . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the button to view a list of languages , click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only type copied . &quot;
&quot; the filter replacement filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ e@@ Filter box if all input fields are empty . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the character replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( blan@@ ks ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ ambig@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; the speaker sel@@ ector filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; giving a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the narr@@ ator features that the program proposes , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the features of the speaker set up on the card card . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . if installed on your system der &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access them with a click on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the right button to view the dialog box selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings , or delete all settings . &quot;
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ e@@ Filter box if applicable . you must register at least one condition .

&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ trans@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you have to do that even if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and you can find on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the option character encoding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be remedi@@ ed by a string replace filter . &quot;

&quot; before you start &amp; t@@ t , check first if speech dispat@@ cher works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; it is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the tool t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech dis@@ pat@@ ters is directly possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual pro@@ positions . the user can go back to pro@@ posi@@ tional or sub@@ sets , repeat the output or cancel . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it can be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the Add @-@ on tab to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Box Card Spe@@ aker Setup will be shown . for example , the installation of the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is made automatically . commonly , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and this gray is displayed , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t make these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( on larger memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed when starting kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not yet run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed phrase . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card @-@ card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . learn more about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; choose the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
put the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ 0@@ ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented the program must be installed so@@ x .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ale ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; you can set up special actions on this card , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ notification messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications appears . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de pre@@ reading ; if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications where a sound is played are tagged by &amp; kt@@ ales ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following options :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard chooses the speaker displayed in the list on the card @-@ card speaker as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All al@@ erts for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the notification al@@ erts as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the messages in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
&quot; you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C &quot; - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / W3@@ C / TR / speech synthesis . &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts to divide text into individual pro@@ positions . this allows you to manually jump or pause orders , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to get to know the set @-@ up of the speakers is by selecting . turn on the list of speakers , select what speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a few properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first sentence is to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last for a long time . &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything of this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering ) . note , that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the character set . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ ts ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the card card selection menu , you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top@@ most on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
&quot; use the most appropriate speaker , which has all features of a set up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , closest to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is preferred if you know that a specific application is sent text in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all features in the speaker area closest to the following , click on the default speaker , and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input is 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message that states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / links . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , the program must be installed so@@ x and be ind@@ able via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card card for subscri@@ ber units . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ p filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta does not seem to work the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER . so the festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a self @-@ explan@@ atory filter and now I can go back or forth ; no more stat@@ ely orders will be displayed , the order will consist only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for the pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the command @-@ register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ lined fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously play music and start a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freezes in addition , if you stop a text order and then start another . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; you have &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . go to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them have run time dependency on non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian GNU guidelines ) . &quot;
&quot; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ file echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you start &amp; t@@ t , check first if your voice synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA synthes@@ izer . then festival will take over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival produces this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the file festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA festival . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the error correction is not required , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this procedure uses special code to give the language of the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , and make sure both of them work . then download festival @-@ Czech from &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice synthes@@ izer that currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search for Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speaking speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ .@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA website and un@@ zip it into the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or after / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;

&quot; epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak langu@@ agues . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ s programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map speaker . enter in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; that is , you need to install the Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; this enables the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network setting is displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware does not need to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured already function@@ ally , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ esses the device at all and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices installing &amp; Linux are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when selecting the network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the dealer selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best suits the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting non @-@ recurring requests , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , click the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab &apos;s network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Networks section :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... in the dialog box set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the &quot; &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; &quot; button to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , the TCP / IP address must be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can find out if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or disabled depending on your needs . switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list , and clicking on the interface ... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or disabled depending on need . switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list , and de@@ activating interface ... &quot;
&quot; establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; button ... a DNS server can be added from the group host to the name resolution . it will display the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and click the Edit button .... There will be the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the name commonly known hosts file name to IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains names that are named by name , the loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add button . if the familiar host has several alias names , press de button addition several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog Con@@ vers@@ ed Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately active in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be conveyed . &quot;
IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is given or , if available , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; this section contains the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections so that it is not surprised if , in case of active DSL connections , there is a different content to be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . therefore , another stand as expected may occur . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that lets you run other programs after a schedule in the background . it &apos;s a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . &quot;
&quot; if the task is de@@ activated , the program name and parameter are not displayed and the description will be disabled . &quot;
the environment variables appearing here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks listed below . a de@@ activated variable is de@@ activated as description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks -@@ folder . then go to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively you can click on the Tas@@ ks folder with the right mouse button and select C@@ tr@@ l ; N in the appearing context menu . &quot;
&quot; enter here the name of the program to be started . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you specify monthly ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be performed both on a suitable date and on a matching day of the week . if you select for example 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the chosen months regardless of the day of the week , and on every Sunday of the month , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only active when the c@@ ron@@ tab is stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select cli@@ pping , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X. &quot;

&quot; alternatively , you can click on the variable with the right mouse button and select Activ@@ ated . make sure the name and value of the variable is displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to store the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot;
alternatively you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are only active then .
&quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose un@@ folding , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on options ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change user schedules . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses &amp; UNIX default commands ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective release . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ ls the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . don &apos;t recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the scre@@ wing on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the index index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape by folding out the entry . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a tape card must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not match the format at &amp; k@@ dat yet . if your tape drive requires a tape before being used , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape by &amp; k@@ dat ; however , flo@@ ppy drives do not usually require format@@ ting of tape . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat continues ; with the format@@ ting of the tape , all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only secure this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears checking . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can recre@@ ate the index on two types of tape :
&quot; as a result , a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can set the following settings for a safety profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files that reside on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be separately stored in backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to identify changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape tool .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option at flo@@ ppy streams . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system will leave the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all , the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files usually find themselves in the directory / var / log , for normal users usually no authorization to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or according to entered strings . the list of log rows is now automatically changed , so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , also select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then be matched only with entries in the corresponding column . in addition , select the name of a process in the Log file system protocol , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are indicated with a more conspic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the level indicator .
&quot; if you want to show a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the pop @-@ up menu of the main window to show all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ s@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing for the control of program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux world ; and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to system V in@@ it , without installing a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following folder : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial which is only once started . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to execute a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
&quot; the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default running level is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server run@@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the required run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the number number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to change between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ working . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions will simplify the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry saved in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have made advanced system settings . only if you have enabled limited restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can customize individual settings . other cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix . &quot;
&quot; the card card password management appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; this card card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limitation of space in KB : &quot;
