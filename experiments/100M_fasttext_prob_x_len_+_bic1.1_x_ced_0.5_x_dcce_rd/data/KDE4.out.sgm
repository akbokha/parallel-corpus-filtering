<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; provides another view for objects using the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"B & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; an entry in the Treemap depiction is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for the slight detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property like Name, Owner, Group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected. frames are drawn to show the nested entries, and this framework will need space which will then no longer be available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for the labelling and avoidance of space losses through framework, so that rectangles arise that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on an area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may be used to connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"digicame; uses the gphoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the machine. as photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support, so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the extif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to drag thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicame; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Project (Manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>

<seg id="83">"a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter works on the filename only if this is shown in the symbol view."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree."</seg>

<seg id="188">"of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems."</seg>
<seg id="189">"while most electric devices do not matter much, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage. so protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money."</seg>
<seg id="190">"the most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy storage and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector strip. however, remember that not every connector strip also contains an overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should be aware that it fulfils the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should pay attention to the fact that all peripherals connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers also manufacture overvoltage contactors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it may be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply."</seg>
<seg id="195">"besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and shut down the system. some models will allow them to continue working until the current runs. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="196">"a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to euro; 20 costs, a 500W USV you can pay for less than 1 euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="197">"the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.

<seg id="198">"you are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB of cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution."</seg>
<seg id="200">"Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to have your pictures in full resolution online."</seg>
<seg id="201">"from the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desktop-safe."</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">"the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you have one day to open a photo and this to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interruption within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>
<seg id="205">"even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year."</seg>
<seg id="206">"ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a low level and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard."</seg>
<seg id="207">"Oracle has launched its own initiative with its own file system, which is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel."</seg>
<seg id="208">"do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% on workstation systems. for laptops, the share of thefts is 50%."</seg>
<seg id="209">"data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lesser damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="210">"open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems."</seg>
<seg id="211">"journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost."</seg>
<seg id="212">"viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss."</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limitations. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">"today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather worsens. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats."</seg>
<seg id="215">"you get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. so, backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives."</seg>
<seg id="216">"if, then one day, a flash hit you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="217">"a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. do not forget aircraft incidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house."</seg>
<seg id="218">"therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar."</seg>
<seg id="219">"there is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day."</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time where such backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>

<seg id="227">"so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:"</seg>
<seg id="228">"because the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you need to look at all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way than to make a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future."</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered already based on the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is available today for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>

<seg id="236">"open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year."</seg>
<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. however, it can store much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is capable of storing gamma- and chromaticity data for improved colour allocation for heterogeneous platforms."</seg>
<seg id="239">"TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files."</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the needs of the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and indebted to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>
<seg id="244">"import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup."</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">"for a fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs."</seg>

<seg id="261">"cameras use as file names for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names. the file names are normally reused once the photos are deleted from the camera. therefore, it may be useful to incorporate the date and time on which the image was made into the file name."</seg>

<seg id="297">"with the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm."</seg>
<seg id="298">"with the option TIFF files, you can compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works lossless."</seg>
<seg id="299">"with the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossless setup, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG."</seg>
<seg id="300">"in previous versions of & digikam, image processing was just an image viewer for photos. currently, it evolves very quickly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing."</seg>
<seg id="301">"the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd rows, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option marks the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when white balance is not set. standard is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. this option is ignored for other cameras.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the pointed lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as it displays the setting through white in the settings. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights to reconstruct."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible, as blue pixels are generally not satiated as quickly as green and red. and dcrav therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digikam. to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaising algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as a CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">"after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenization Directed) was the first algorithm used by Drapw. however, it generates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result."</seg>
<seg id="311">"if you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for colour softening as you are carried out during raw conversion."</seg>

<seg id="318">"there are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be given by a device. this is very useful before you print picture, as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that you have from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed and scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the topic comes to colour management, everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information enable you to make informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflows meet all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>

<seg id="381">"your only other picture editions are via e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another colour space and have to worry about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, balance, Automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values across the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot can be changed as brightly as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparisons very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range, and a re-jibing of all values in between."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if so far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on the shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjuster lets you improve or also dimming the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it into a text file and load later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles allows you to consult chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under color sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, allowing you to use it for several photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created by a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negatives of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar process. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called" "Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a coloured film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are too much for a few photographers especially those who have hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in case of large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color extracts of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">"in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the instrument sound value correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, logarithmic arrangement is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpness is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask is working on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not sharpen a bit, it rather works psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocussing is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to combine colors with minimal differences to one color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink spots are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used in internal sharpness. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter already while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the focus on sharpening. this can be done using the menu item" "Correct sharpness". ""</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen a picture can refocus the tool. in general, you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry Correct softener and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the filter output with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensify the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from the sharpness and therefore avoided beauty errors in faces, celestial and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">"the & digikam, tool refocussing refocussing a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyrighted distortion filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe."</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. refocussing usually achieves better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, circular folding works much better than the Gauss-fold. the Gauß 'sche fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixies, which are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are very rare. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. it is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you modify the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will subsequently leave incomplete artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of sharpness. for the Vienna filter, it is always possible to show that it is the optimum Linear Filter. the results of the FIR Vienna filter are always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>

<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the Rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpening should be subsequently necessary."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a movie grain or CCD rushes will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG Triartefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm will go through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, it should also be small."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime."</seg>

<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the drop size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can keep the range free of raindrops; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>

<seg id="650">"harmonic triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden centre is a division based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational figure 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold center provides liquid relief lines if you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spirale will give you good results for your photos. compared to the third-hand rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Options mirror and mirror vertical mirrors can be used to reflect the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button, you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things rotate around an angle. you can fix this with the camera; image editing and the tool free rotation. select it Transforming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is shown on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have turned a picture, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is to use the function Transforming cutting from image processing."</seg>

<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after turning. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>

<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly greased. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double that powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the scoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal line, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left."</seg>

<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>

<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category Persons of the imported file (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"'--preset standard' = This setting should usually be acceptable for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi hi-fi systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is manually entered or retrieved by the software automatically from the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / used with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) when encoding MP3s with lame, the -t of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -t {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters which can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself. it is to be noted that only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: that is the author) I am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any information can be caused by a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more about it, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the encoder package must be installed by the concerned linux distribution, before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders are in the Diver chapter."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this may have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading rights and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, this is over 620 MB in size, the two selection boxes need to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card."</seg>

<seg id="1587">"note: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words are beginning with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"you can change tag information of the created files later any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags."</seg>

<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can, for example, be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio of pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if therefore a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM suggests that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, will play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, try a bit with & kmid; try around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos, you see which sounds are played right now."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't glean more green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality."</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card holders with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for more information about these areas."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many points. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later any number of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful when two people work independently of each other on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & kdiff3; for automatic selection of the correct changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly."</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and leaned against the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more annoyance if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other one differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog opens the manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"via the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merging or merging of folders is initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with settings. you can specify options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor, and drop it over a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you'd have to create two corresponding files, upload them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) each info line has a different color. (note that Windows C is too long, allow the mouse to rest over the line for a while.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the settings menu.)"</seg>

<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes.

<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>

<seg id="2499">"kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of your computer may also cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet."</seg>

<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which places a mouseclick is left without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"if your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball."</seg>

<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, it provides & ksystemlog; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup, & ksystemlog; first of all, the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files usually find themselves in the directory / var / log, for normal users usually no authorization to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or according to entered strings. the list of log rows is now automatically changed, so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, also select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then be matched only with entries in the corresponding column. in addition, select the name of a process in the Log file system protocol, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are indicated with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the level indicator.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the pop-up menu of the main window to show all new incoming protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemslog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further up-to-date information about the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing for the control of program starts when running the system in the & Linux world; and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to system V init, without installing a new installation and re-formatting. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysit and the following folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial which is only once started. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to execute a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"the default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default running level is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel which & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to only copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the required runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the number number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to change between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly reworking. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are launched in these distributions will simplify the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: please check that all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>

<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only displayed if you have made advanced system settings. only if you have enabled limited restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created where you can customize individual settings. other cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unix."</seg>
