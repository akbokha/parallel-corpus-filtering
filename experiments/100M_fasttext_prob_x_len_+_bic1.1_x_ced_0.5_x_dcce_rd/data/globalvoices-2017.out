&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , set up the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the United States had only increased . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp arrived .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from around the world , a deeply believing person with whom I talked about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tru@@ mp Welt@@ anschau@@ ung agreed not with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who lives the environment for her life and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp beg@@ ged his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , it is hard to forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O.@@ B. ) : &quot; as much as the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in allu@@ sions to the Wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones called , has just killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America means everyone welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , is nowhere else in the world possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s white promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; shou@@ ted the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp country , &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse and bankrupt@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; however , after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope for hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments very seriously against the music group , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez began to transform parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o something , which he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already practi@@ sed illegal fishing in Liberia , before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the East African countries were upset and inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior lecturer of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . it is therefore the main cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliberate violation of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal regime . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . this means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales that the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lost each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licensed papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
until now the closed front functions .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found volati@@ le ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross it , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which cannot be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
one model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide through the position of every tra@@ ck@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project with which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships which had been f@@ ished without a license and hardly expected consequences now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved at F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Security is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member land was able to report its first great triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship flying under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road even without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still penet@@ rated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of returning the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government &apos;s government rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ balance , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by drawing on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example , the recovery of Venezuela ) , images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country , including the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the An@@ den@@ sit@@ ing regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , located in the central north @-@ lying Bun@@ de@@ staat , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest articles the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , the demonstr@@ ators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike , and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the Action Plan &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the March , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about confron@@ tations as well as reports of repression and mal@@ treatment . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the central north @-@ lying city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
meanwhile an info@@ graphic shows the round which covers the extent of suppression per day :
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a disclosure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .

&quot; others value these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and preferred to make critical voices heard : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , with crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept the secret of family secrets . &quot;
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , realized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
its history shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
&quot; pass only on , that they will not escape you one day and I have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would be en@@ vious . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; then the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I stepped in and saw a lying down on which people were tortured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were fixing it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they in@@ frequently bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a fil@@ thy whi@@ rl@@ wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never could forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye pads . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; close to the entrance , people cau@@ tioned sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed a man there .
&quot; according to information from survivors of the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina sentenced to death . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ ees came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one takes against an enemy one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I replied : and you who steal cars on the road ?
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried out : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
this was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes back home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one real@@ ises the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been possible to put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
did these people not even have families to whom one could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they picked up machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of , no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course there is always something .
I have seen how you killed people !
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of communicating my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to witness because of him .
&quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ wardly rejected and asked me what the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they claimed , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I paid the first advertisement . &quot;
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can pret@@ end to me that I am pre@@ occupied . finally , I have said against my own father . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death row in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of age . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court sentenced him to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ ken : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government delivered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be established , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO a &quot; aw@@ ful driver &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , in which one can extend its driving license . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long their driving license , last month witnessed a particularly un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield the Japanese word , which means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ sen@@ sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; , &quot; was wrong@@ ly mistaken - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind thanks &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful driver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; edit the original Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , often shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could such an English translation come ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked about the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the named re@@ porter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ w against older drivers :
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among others , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful driver &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How defective is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , who could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the Japanese co @-@ workers whose English skills are considered to be the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and enig@@ matic sentences , which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zzling prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless , as jewelry . but from big companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was stuck , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of the Venezu@@ el@@ an ISP are once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant since 2014 in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
&quot; aston@@ ish@@ ingly , that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of li@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNA . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds incor@@ rectly or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to the show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a short report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , waste schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she , from which something has become &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay there are more than 4@@ 6.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives her minor son or her minor daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society , and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and den@@ oun@@ cing . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ mean is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and can &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it only a few years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship , received a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military team Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ ICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; lam@@ ented Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children un@@ punished . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a spe@@ edy investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ mean
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the way , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn . &quot;
she got up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she had finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but this time too was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read editorial papers from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he kept her intellig@@ ently , but did not enter@@ tain herself with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;

the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share posts for cleaning staff and pa@@ w@@ ns in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please announce yourselves .
&quot; starting Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the display switched on again :
&quot; love girl@@ friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I am writing again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas report , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies from former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to ens@@ la@@ ve and to their &quot; wives &quot; ) . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian Members of Parliament recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; regulation on use and benefits of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is responsible for granting citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must be registered on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , made up of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video news and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on the users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users of the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Ministry a username and password to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . for those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control forci@@ bly physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislature &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which sense control is maxim@@ ised and should be ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those convic@@ ted to threaten &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who stre@@ w through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , has made the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a major pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensu@@ ing ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour@@ hoods Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal towns away from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to dec@@ ember 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of planned replacement houses ( in terms of the number of qu@@ arri@@ es in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) were completed . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from accommodation establishments ( in order to be able to be able to reloc@@ ate the cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ u@@ ut@@ ac@@ u ) into final replacement houses , even six years after the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , almost 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster in shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have been passion@@ ately involved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma could be re @-@ used . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it is for those who had to evacu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has also witnessed the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan has ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; out of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ated vehicles from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 state , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people , who still live in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one real@@ ises that it connects more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that get much less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has strengthened their affection for Iranian culture , and Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten up by police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a bat@@ on against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified with it . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ carp@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s briefly point to it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was arrested by a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , having been attacked by a police officer , after being attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick . &quot;
police raid on the road
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there were brutal police attacks on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers sat at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media ou@@ sted street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported on a broken glass window , in order to make their titles illustr@@ ative with a photo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a burned @-@ in bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be acknowledged if you are strictly opposed to any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the ent@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba included the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been la@@ under@@ ed .
&quot; after the earthquake , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and shuttle every day to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene ev@@ okes that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a subject for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church had already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete and hardly competitive for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day today will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eption . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to receive the place , they formed a full time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more common . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , which was still in operation , &quot; he asser@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he with@@ drew , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of employment . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work lat@@ ch was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the plants in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the people who were present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , Gregory Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to demol@@ ish it , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , and also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ two harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , but he does not forgive the lies that one told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is in retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of traveling workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop thus arises that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs were published in Indi@@ genous Langu@@ ages , although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has been recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved gave some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in reverse , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the Day when you will forgive our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and also go forward with our youth . &quot;
so they can do what they intended to the Creator
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the stop@@ per in sy@@ ll@@ ad@@ heading ( which is also published on his blog and is re @-@ published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is now turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin cri@@ m@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons , decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ vels of fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple which holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
&quot; some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ che@@ ating is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon . &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more bizarre plastic dishes , you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , in order to get to the &quot; &quot; Rhin@@ opla@@ sty &quot; &quot; number . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and Get@@ ting regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone finds in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire municipalities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father in only one day , lost her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing ourselves to look for the task we have set ourselves , and to search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay it off because it requires a death certificate . &quot;
where are we going to get it ? &quot;
the editors of A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the leadership of the state . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Poli@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; her contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been acquainted with illness and sensation journ@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the bound@@ lessness of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified , that they were &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t stir and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals st@@ ole money from their business month by month until they had destroyed the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain is never passing away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits changed , phone numbers also changed . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence @-@ drawn generation . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a force through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings according to the citizens &apos; council for public safety and government of the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages to which it links contains pictures showing violence .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something first appeared ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false pairing of picture and event - &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; wrong context &quot; &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the Place S@@ ange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thus rav@@ aged . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
tra@@ gically it fell victim to that of the tank truck .
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the football world champi@@ onships . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for dish@@ on@@ esty .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been lab@@ elled , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Nig@@ eri@@ an army and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from DR Congo again when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , the ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly fal@@ si@@ fy the image of DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a bl@@ itz , published by the United Nations , those who fled could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following have brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 wrong@@ ly claimed that President Burma Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on the last of April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that named AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein Sein have attributed this statement , but did not bring the picture out of DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false h@@ oppel@@ ings date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can exceed boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix of private pages , social media platforms , and national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded incorrect reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which they have been published . this way , we want to show the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also associated with each other ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be completely detected ( on the map in orange ) :

country examples of false copy of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma ? Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread about the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this post , pointing to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo shows no Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .

&quot; this article from 2014 on students who have been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ olische nearest news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;

&quot; after a message which was allegedly written in circulation by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image was contained in DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggregate and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) inks too , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture eventually bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong subjects or frames , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used with regard to major discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper issue is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and does the actual horror of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding pictures of a refusal is equal to the recognition of the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent ima@@ gery readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media act upon helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can also be used detached from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. un@@ enfor@@ ce@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
&quot; these words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese su@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years .
and words in the language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
&quot; they determined other cultures , reveal other ways of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; uns@@ ett@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite songs here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and epide@@ mic disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya joined the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement from the Sri Lanka catastrophe centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and some hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls started on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already underway . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a yesterday . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u Trop@@ ical Tower , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide support measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; use appro@@ dam@@ t.@@ So in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next few years , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some consider the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ atter slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they mi@@ tig@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice different religions .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is designed so well in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in as I do there , are mi@@ tig@@ ated . &quot;
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I am not alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most often sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western notion , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the duk@@ tion@@ ist ima@@ gery of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to act . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that over the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative will fail to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this powerful narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead moti@@ ons for change .
it is evident that the first Muslim prayers on American soil were spoken by Afri@@ cans who were brought hi@@ erh@@ in with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has so deep and fla@@ wed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ tim@@ ed attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ racial Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my im@@ migrant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then when Khan reas@@ oned to the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of picking up my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , whom all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; from respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born into my imagination only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf would see that I am Mos@@ lem if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran , who seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim sense is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete painting painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how it taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , which - over centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which established a company called &quot; &quot; Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie &quot; , &quot; it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my im@@ migrant grandfather we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family which he could not close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ an sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before planes were air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ founded story .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried among the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy makes the US home and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that a African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ jun@@ c@@ ations but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders with people from just countries that are bombar@@ ding it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we run and the bombs , which we shed on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to carry out
we are too deeply disturbed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous im@@ prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news editors .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
&quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot;
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim . &quot;
things I left in my speech like a bread@@ crum@@ b track .
&quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia take place . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read them in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being w@@ aged and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public perception , four decades ago , even scientist of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of how my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , while he already had broken lands and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story@@ telling , by fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; in short , Global Vo@@ ices reported a different initiative of Steven Bird , the plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS does not lie on the written word but on the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project the following applies :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , hist@@ ories tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and their depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience is insi@@ sting on it . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the Zimbabwe language : &quot;

Puerto Rico calls for res@@ titu@@ tion of state debt from the US
&quot; with the aim of a new inspection of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 . the March started at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos call for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts to take responsibility for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a manag@@ erial committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves in falling pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state of state of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law for corporate responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration wore the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , prints excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective Refle@@ ction ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with this . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and in order to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book , entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce , gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military unit , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court out of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; his where@@ ab@@ outs , however , remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes was more obvious than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which not only represents the cultural heritage of Syria , but of the world . &quot;
this strip of digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail : &quot;
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and he taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
he opened the door to technology for me . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in detention . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care for any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the prison &apos;s crow@@ ding
and I &apos;ll go into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; that I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes bid farewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile at your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el :
&quot; one year goes by , my soul &quot;
during the day
&quot; I in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sel &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : head of corruption sentenced by corruption to previous post
&quot; with anger , Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption case where a government member returned to the state apparatus after half of his sentence of imprisonment on which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants for em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who rejected the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to restore its old post as the company did not execute disciplinary procedures after its detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call this action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have introduced disciplinary action against the contrary .
&quot; the company was apparently silent , however , and did not take reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has left half of it . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
resist !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director doesn &apos;t have any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return to the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served itself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state when it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ be@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison not only for ever @-@ ever @-@ independent president but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he for@@ c@@ efully confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interests . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn off his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was in prison for 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , in which he makes money , sets him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ ρ@@ ο@@ ν ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) , 12 May 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo published by the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mos@@ ambique &apos;s th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long @-@ term detention , returns to # Air@@ ports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or &quot; &quot; Al@@ ways &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ati@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ itted A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there have been several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it del@@ etes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write about .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the adjacent words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting legs ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who are spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was alert to this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not meet . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have begun this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have a great deal of turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech , but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook has removed the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people then ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also stimulate violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to take control of the ramp@@ ant hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s mono@@ gam@@ y
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country voted unanim@@ ously a law to ban this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group called representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago became a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 were in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ev@@ oked tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was approved by the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws on the children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who dresses a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , disgu@@ ised at the core of the matter , but do you know what ? &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ ging News ! &quot;
the mar@@ ital law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group which spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft to am@@ end the marriage law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 depu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all depu@@ ties who were admitted have voted in favour of the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ sp@@ ag@@ ro@@ hl@@ p@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our depu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible catch comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj publicly announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to release his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , argued that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj had wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users wished that the debate would address the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; rather , instead of talking about the problem , if we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are opposed to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children in different grades are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; for more than a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia , based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share useful information and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform removed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , despite legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the news ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put all the snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least check all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a mirrors page from Wikipedia , and Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if in particular country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices and staff at mo@@ z@@ illa at Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ cking N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry , with badly positioned motives and well @-@ washed colours . &quot;
that motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that focus on Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to take pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood by face to face &#91; with &#93; face to face , &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sits down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ys@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should desp@@ ise the norm , this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a bog@@ us court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated her family and the village community , after addressing a married relative with her name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far less access to fear if at all they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , entered into a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands according to their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have uph@@ eld and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not commit this will be regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands but they can call us as they want , does this mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese of the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only sne@@ aked in front of herself , another decided to leave the whole face of fru@@ stration with him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head , and his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot;
another member of the club decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law was star@@ ing at her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less intel@@ li@@ gible and the situation got out of force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he would do it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped working with them completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ami @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , their own pair of kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) smu@@ g@@ gled into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
we have only done little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japanese visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29th June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese t@@ witter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese twist . &quot;
people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day in Japan . at the age of 51 , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kite of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should be John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese , of course , also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band . &quot;
&quot; 1 . if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
&quot; just today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day . &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
so we hope you are there !

bald men are kidn@@ apped and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be a target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ trafficking , presumably for un@@ believing purposes , al@@ armed the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now sum@@ mon@@ ed a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently allowed the organs of sham@@ ans to be used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could reveal gold or bring riches , explained the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South Africa conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; be@@ ware of k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the police after the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of In@@ ham@@ band in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of young people for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably ab@@ bey rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , who also claim that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in the head of power , the wealth generation . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with loss of hair were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha gave on Facebook the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like to go to E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed to go to the streets as if they were ashamed to take sex against good notes , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or gl@@ atz@@ headed would be hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour . &quot;
&quot; Ale@@ ppo Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ atz@@ ky : &quot;

&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : Ne@@ ar Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer at the terminal stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Risk ) after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs in China , referred to as &quot; an internal issue , &quot; and told a spokesman , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the stringent treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway on the road
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon farms to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;

&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 , around Li@@ u and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or countryside ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered as a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and self @-@ sacrifice to create this valuable land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , he was inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic , since they are better suited to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies . &quot;
he ar@@ ticul@@ ates corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as it was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critics that you should start reading the whole address of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the head@@ line .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ easy , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , &quot; &quot; Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice spoke of Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , properly associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advocate ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both country and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but do they not defend their city ? &quot;
who must our prime minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ID ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore tends to be a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies like &quot; &quot; defense of the country mainly &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook inner@@ ly against anger when they are kept for Americans but I don &apos;t bother them . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you &apos;d change me to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be di@@ ligent - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; ( which has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being inno@@ cu@@ ous means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major achievement of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau tou@@ red the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video which par@@ o@@ zes the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells what regulations his girlfriend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times was distributed and received 8,@@ 800 songs . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ sever@@ ingly pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army that monitors online content and persons accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy is prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand deplo@@ ys a strictly against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ ority insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup in the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; the video shows how people are thrown into a black van , before moving into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in the society and Internet users are threatened long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; was already being used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the Spirit @-@ cities in eastern Asia Minor .

&quot; the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ lov . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an War was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ lov show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Co@@ al basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the majority of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; more than 10,000 people lived here in the pre @-@ war period , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 after having barely climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; around 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are decay and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to quit .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were local centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which houses one or two families , can be seen on balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us to let us take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she abandoned the destroyed building and disappeared .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small female with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,@@ 50 dollars per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the show@@ room there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez explains , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a beard @-@ beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; he says smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone , to greet them or to report about their journey . &quot;
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; on the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen area outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step . &quot;
&quot; back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests again . &quot;
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , travelers always consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair sta@@ ins she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sad as she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya , fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , as well as in the &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the app would detect and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remote @-@ controlling their home network . &quot;
this app for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ ons of digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , oppressed ethnic minorities like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; based on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police checked the residents random@@ ly to check if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which results from the fact that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard disk of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all branches of government , government and party institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes all the glory of its name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality picks you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dissolve in smoke , and you become aware of your existence even when the Earth moves on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone stone was built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
&quot; all quarters of the city sought , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is plu@@ gged into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down a bit , after the power supply stopped in the quarter . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ing the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me , and we joined together to create a magnificent picture filled with my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; Be ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I do now .
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you write Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; and you &apos;re tru@@ sting what to look at me , not on the ground ! &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure about my cause when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is in my nose to this day .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I take care of all the details before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike otherwise , they have probably allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an outdated method of communication : to beat the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell gen@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; first prisoner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be seen in me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice is similar to me ?
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him , if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13 pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow focal point of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ torium and hit Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have become accustomed to not answering .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks . &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams weren &apos;t enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , so he went next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed that happened to me as minutes ago .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fearful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be la@@ yed . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors , sometimes he hur@@ ls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spotted lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year that Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village to Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ as ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality , and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with issues like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he har@@ bors a special en@@ vy against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b examines his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian prisoner of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan , and never before was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into water dissolved nest café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , during which time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the dro@@ pl@@ ings speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ ots of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while Ram@@ adan is drinking water - in order not to land in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jord@@ ani@@ ens Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some of the MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front @-@ singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the depu@@ ties and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to pursue an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be simply a rhet@@ or@@ ical rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s traditional sex men moved to Lei@@ be by abol@@ ishing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently broken , unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; detained in@@ definitely in prison &quot; &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known for being shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was introduced to politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where man , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were greatly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were swept away from the context and had been cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ da , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : &quot; &quot; if Abu Nu@@ i , who should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ ers later , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that comments in social media have been critical to the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and basic frank@@ ness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially produced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the hard @-@ wag@@ ons , the drums and the dancing were taken over more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;

I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high drive was incredible .

young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and straight raz@@ ors

&quot; outer appearance and body care seldom have been as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like that of the Fris@@ e@@ urs . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ bery and illegal drug dealers are all daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and the resulting hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens to go into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts face each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only secondary school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , as we have built up this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of Love to Guer@@ il@@ la@@ fighters

&quot; the following article is the revised version of the article &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ bitions to Guer@@ il@@ la@@ fighters &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write letters of love to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel expelled , to receive affection ? &quot;
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ ree Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters from the Young Youth Foundation .
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which constitutes the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace agreement was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to military rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , to welcome them back to society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ ic Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they did before , in order to accept the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours , from fear to happiness and all that lies between them , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters were living ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , he was sorry to be all the years the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ elu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC gathered together for a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already operating in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state imp@@ acted upon the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
but it comforts me that all people - also those who have been killed and caused so much harm to bring us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms to rise up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not just over night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the ab@@ duction , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities arrested by suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and hiding them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ fu@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she finally moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ fu@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos from my documents made the lap by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ sta@@ ck ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had taken everything and started scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wing .
&quot; OC Media : in which cases were you laid , in which of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has gone respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running top without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just a bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster that is not just your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she put a rope around his neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering me , without notice , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; but we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat@@ ting with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks , to which she reminds herself of her past - that is , my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed here ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
&quot; he told us that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : are you still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons , too ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there were not so many .
&quot; if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held down there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they should be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were immersed in a targeted way in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was detained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about it yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I was living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
to be in the grave !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to approach us to &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wearing tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria never cur@@ bed me only one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you , because they believed you were ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did it last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who laugh@@ ed before , laugh@@ ed at you once with suspicion . &quot;
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worsen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I c@@ apped out breeding places .
I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
&quot; this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to show you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all about it - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August moved the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments when he lighted himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the basis of persecution from the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , based on a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab territories to the Persian territory , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture and the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ stur@@ i youngsters increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and have completed 45 % of the university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired , since even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given to the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be feminist and why we should generally be female . &quot;
&quot; for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware of and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old underneath .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to talk of skin color , on racism , on black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been subjected to racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to reach equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men every skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injus@@ tices in her mind , which relate both to sex and on the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ s compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman in historical terms is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alised being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of inc@@ ision of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement still@@ ness , no matter how many black women attempt to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still is in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : recall culture : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am acknowledged as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither ignored , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported in@@ special about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are worried that decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the main focus of her work lies on persecuted , poorly regarded sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a Police In@@ spec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the detailed A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez adver@@ t also avail@@ ed nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women complain at all , they generally do not receive any support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to being victims of violence , are at all reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which is not subordin@@ ated to Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation blows and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ gy@@ ms , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 women reported on domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in peace courts . here , too , 86 % of the advertisements were made by women . &quot;
&quot; in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman , which is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or ex partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which does not under@@ mine &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should always regret her . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise : &quot;
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victori@@ as adver@@ ts with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it mainly went on money , power and influence of its former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays legislation : good approach and poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ing and fighting corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for@@ eig@@ ne ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was altered in a number of points in order to win the MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was denied , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and being punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original draft was intended , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence in the present time , if they simply wish to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient financial means :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the offen@@ se of offen@@ ders . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se so long until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for in cases of domestic violence to reconci@@ le . &quot;
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section relating to reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law however is considered a major set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Information Minister &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ bian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be imprisoned where he is serving a year@@ long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later they were released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had defeated his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he has been suffering the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , to torture and incar@@ cer@@ ate human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance controversy . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Mr. Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information issued the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was held before the Court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the State . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of breach of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amounting to 3000 om@@ bian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to dissemin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he served his imprisonment .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months , and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated press freedom .
&quot; further injuries include closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities are still not ready to put an end to the comprehensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the Syrian authorities to : &quot;
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather peace , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : for one , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of global healthcare . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to establish own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic has shown serious implications for national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the Pennsylvania University , he tested himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I am currently launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GV : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being mo@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not good to use in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what kind of obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and acade@@ mics in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that periodic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ding , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salads it can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents do not only apply for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green colour or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer since its work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to dol@@ lop .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salad of the Out@@ red@@ ding variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and so can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may undertake to freely use the seed bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow others who cross their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the ability to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seeds , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; he says , and refers to the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered on farmers markets , and should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available genetic pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , is inc@@ ess@@ antly shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they exhibit desirable characteristics - from those , by which their taste or color improves to such ones , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders carries more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more important than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property encourages other breeders , because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations encourage innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees this different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it is impossible to make use of the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves , and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are required for their cultivation of massive her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they manage to survive most small seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ enting : &quot; it looks like I work with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years against competition , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , however , the concept spreads quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is launching an open @-@ source seed programme . &quot;
it also helps them to get to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding vary from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which the official start @-@ up should be scheduled for the next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada ) and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context by which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities blocked content on the Internet . &quot;
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist met .
&quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored web page of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s Qatar network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the Colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he wrote for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Canada &apos;s blog is located , on the other hand , is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in jail after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed his views on the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ ay@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even though the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in providing me with the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , a tried @-@ and @-@ tested murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs and any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , af@@ te documented the blocking of vendors , through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can act against these actions in court . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian Army was deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;
&quot; photo by : Est@@ ado Mai@@ or ( C@@ ML ) via photos P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ as , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; newspapers throughout Brazil are reporting glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rus@@ hes dru@@ g@@ stores with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air coffee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the paper said the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a military ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not know the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ i@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence can be called &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as witnessed in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; to call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ i@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is on No@@ .@@ 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; added to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ i@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has increasingly been under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quotes from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost glob@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
one week it is now that the police declare the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syrians living in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition agree on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege from Damascus , which led residents to rely on locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled goods by tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones cultivated in Syria , and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the diver@@ t of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ mei@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ation of fung@@ i , &quot; says Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people who are mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break@@ age of the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity .

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
&quot; on October 21st , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that came to the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 injured after the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cian region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s situation : there is no fire in only 4 districts .
&quot; the whole of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users split images :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ gos@@ PT
numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the Des@@ cent tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ et of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have happened again as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which permitted the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val writes in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , became more and more widespread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this type . &quot;
&quot; these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people were seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the fo@@ undry application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the server was not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the path from refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together in G@@ haz@@ ni province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe never again . &quot;
&quot; at dawn , the boy should break open . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ bollah @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar , which were heavier than himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous voyage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af joined Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help in need twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high twin rates , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers face in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; the system &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; , &quot; which are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible li@@ fes@@ pan helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some Afghan @-@ owned enterprises , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
&quot; the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna , and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail sector and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
&quot; citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt allow the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
shared photo of @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ar Report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration at a government authority .
&quot; users would have to register themselves in order to use social networks within six months following the successful legal decision on the website of the authority , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently in front of the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament submitted a legislative proposal which would be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the alle@@ gation of the President or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under the legislation , however , such action would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly would have been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; just like more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan was sentenced to four years in prison for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , bog@@ us charges of e.g. arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza released two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gated documents
&quot; Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been interro@@ gated mainly by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial bill of law , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption acc@@ use officials am@@ nesty provided they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds . &quot;
&quot; this document , published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation will look . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the People &apos;s Republic of China &apos;s information office , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
in the rules it is also stated that registration will be required with full real name .
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached in conversations within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; in social media , Chinese citizens have proposed to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the State cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat had failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government organizes a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned by web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ bl@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to add a political diff@@ ra@@ ction campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services relating to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
