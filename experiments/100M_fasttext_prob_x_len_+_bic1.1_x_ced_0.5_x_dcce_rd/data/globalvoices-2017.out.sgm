<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, set up the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was it as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the United States had only increased."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I've ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that receives people from around the world, a deeply believing person with whom I talked about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trump Weltanschauung agreed not with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trump Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who lives the environment for her life and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump begged his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, it is hard to forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(O.B.):" as much as the white against all other ethnicities "; word play from white in allusions to the Whites and Whiplash, as the great Van Jones called, has just killed exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America means everyone welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, is nowhere else in the world possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America's white promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "shouted the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump country," "said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a couple of years now the La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse and bankruptcy."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope for hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments very seriously against the music group, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the leadership of Favio Chavez began to transform parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as a Favio something, which he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published in a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already practised illegal fishing in Liberia, before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"accordingly, the East African countries were upset and inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior lecturer of the Kenyan fisheries authority."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegally Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. it is therefore the main cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate violation of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to the FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal regime."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. this means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "then there is considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales that the eight members of the HISH-i network lost each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licensed papers, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-fully organised control system," "says Long." "a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say" "You don't want to run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"the Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross it," "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which cannot be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide through the position of every trackable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project with which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which had been fished without a license and hardly expected consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved at FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "Kiilu says." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"six countries have joined forces there in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing according to the same model as FISH-i." "Security is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's most recent member land was able to report its first great triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship flying under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road even without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still penetrated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the goal of returning the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of the President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the government's government rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on imbalance, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by drawing on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example, the recovery of Venezuela), images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country, including the Barinas lowland area, in the Andensiting regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, located in the central north-lying Bundestaat, Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro; in the end, however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne DÃ­az, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest articles the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, the demonstrators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly."</seg>

<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">"he told me, I would be envious."</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">"then the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - everything was possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I stepped in and saw a lying down on which people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were fixing it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they infrequently bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, overthrew him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts in the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a filthy whirlwind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never could forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore eye pads."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian who was also charged in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"close to the entrance, people cautioned silently on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero made a man there and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to information from survivors of the Jorge Romero, who was also indicted at La Perla-Ribera trial, the students RaÃºl Mateo Molina sentenced to death."</seg>

<seg id="262">The way you came in is also the way where the abducees came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "war of war" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, - I was in Gendarmerie - I realized that war yield is a bayonet or perhaps military signs that one takes against an enemy one has fought."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but if one goes into a house and steals the refrigerator, the record player, clothes, paintings, money... then this is not a war yield but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could take part in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I replied: and you who steal cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You're not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded in anger, struck me and cried out:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, I will find you and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anybody else!</seg>
<seg id="284">This was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the trial, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a pullover of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes back home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last abhorrent act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now that I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, one realises the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during the dictatorship. but why did the corpses leave?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been possible to put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their corpses leave?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhorrent act that one can do to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they picked up machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of, no idea where." you will never find anything, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course there is always something.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of communicating my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to witness because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me what the exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings "they claimed, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me what to say?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied," "Well, then tell me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I paid the first advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="322">I had finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">"no one can pretend to me that I am preoccupied. finally, I have said against my own father."</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre where one can prolong their driving license, last month witnessed a particularly unsuccessful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a shield the Japanese word, which means" "older motorists" "(koreisensha), which means" "older motorists", "was wrongly mistaken - perhaps also with malicious hind thanks & # 8212; as" "awful driver". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"edit the original Joshua Levine's original photos, often shared in social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could such an English translation come?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" elder drivers "(German:" older motorists ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online news service J-Cast News talked about the phenomenon of the "awful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a reason for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, Seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>

<seg id="369">"-" "How defective is the translation actually not at all, isn't it?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the original language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, who could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"nevertheless, the Japanese co-workers whose English skills are considered to be the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic sentences, which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless, as jewelry. but from big companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was stuck, and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet."</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abbreviated version of a short report published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen "(" Flying cows, waste schools ") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before graduating at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"she, from which something has become", "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old she began working as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay there are more than 46.000 young boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money gives her minor son or her minor daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof above the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society, and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, researching and denouncing."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is vaccinated against the Crimean is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family who has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and can" make something out of themselves, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not be educated and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it only a few years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan stewardship, received a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military team TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"MarÃ­n lived with them in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked MarÃ­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be no other Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," "lamented Tina Alvarenga."</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to hurt the rights of children unpunished."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a speedy investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his job."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all the way, and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she had finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>

<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't have unlimited food." I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"in some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and read editorial papers from opposition newspapers such as" "Sendero" "or" "El Pueblo". ""</seg>
<seg id="470">"in doing so, he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dictator."</seg>
<seg id="471">"he kept her intelligently, but did not entertain herself with her." the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics, "she says."</seg>

<seg id="473">"their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible," she explains. "</seg>
<seg id="474">"she was, however, fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work."</seg>
<seg id="475">"in school, too, Alvarenga was discriminated against." a thing about which almost never is spoken is bullying and the harassment that Criaditas are exposed to when they go to school. "</seg>
<seg id="476">"because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita."</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">"in my youth, in the time when friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, edited by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted in Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian Members of Parliament recently agreed to draft legislation on" "regulation on use and benefits of social networks". ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be established, which is responsible for granting citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must be registered on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do this, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, made up of six paragraphs and cursed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video news and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose registration on the users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users of the Telecommunications Ministry a username and password to come through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. for those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they control forcibly physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in which sense control is maximised and should be ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards, who strew through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza passionately shows a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, has made the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture has been a major prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbourhoods Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had left entire coastal towns away from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima Prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to december 2015, a total of 77 per cent of planned replacement houses (in terms of the number of quarries in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) were completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of planned replacement buildings were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from accommodation establishments (in order to be able to be able to relocate the casetsu juuutacu) into final replacement houses, even six years after the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster in shelters were resettled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the nuclear accident have been passionately involved in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima could be re-used."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a total picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed over the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to evacuate the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima Prefecture has also witnessed the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan has ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"out of 160,000 evacuated vehicles from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 state, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated people, who still live in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba included the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been laundered.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the earthquake, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and shuttle every day to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period, because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene evokes that MaÃ±alich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the poor administration decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the message would have been a subject for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church had already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" Agricultural prospects "by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the day today will certainly go into history," "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero."</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">"in the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" deception. ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order to receive the place, they formed a full time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"these were officially written documents, which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more common."</seg>
<seg id="664">"Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters." the country had no money for the sugar cane factories, which was still in operation, "he asserts."</seg>
<seg id="665">"Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waiting for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma."</seg>
<seg id="666">"he was involved in his will at the shutdown of the factory, in which he helped."</seg>
<seg id="667">"with every part he withdrew, he disassembled one of his 31 years of employment."</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work latch was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the plants in the municipalities in which they were located."</seg>
<seg id="670">"we will never know if during Mammut's speech of 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of the people who were present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well."</seg>

<seg id="675">"when the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to demolish it, they also stopped to aspire the road, and also disadvantaged other establishments."</seg>
<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to pick up other factories."</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop, thanks to a series of traveling workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree hip-hop group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop thus arises that the young participants discuss topics such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance, "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"for example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs were published in Indigenous Languages, although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has been recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved gave some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a stopper in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in reverse, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>

<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "plastic models of the dishes" ") are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is now turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin crimu."</seg>

<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitsch collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shovels of fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple which holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-cheating is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there anyone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the missing and Getting regularly appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting about drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind each bone finds in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "which aims to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire municipalities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vique Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="772">Where are we going to get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of Aprender a vivir con el Narco explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Politico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"her contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and sensation journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or files of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories become mere figures in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the boundlessness of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified, that they were" "rebellious". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they don't stir and remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was looted with threats. "it describes how armed criminals stole money from their business month by month until they had destroyed the business, but also tore their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"pain is never passing away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>

<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "Forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence-drawn generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as a force through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killings according to the citizens' council for public safety and government of the government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something first appeared? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false pairing of picture and event -" "false description" "or" "wrong context" "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the Place Sange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and thus ravaged. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically it fell victim to that of the tank truck.</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the football world championships."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned for dishonesty.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "This is Nigeria". "from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was written several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." no one stayed behind to count corpses, "said a citizen of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been labelled, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Nigerian army and the attempt of Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from DR Congo again when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, the abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misconceptions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly falsify the image of DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a blitz, published by the United Nations, those who fled could strike blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following have brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which in 2012 wrongly claimed that President Burma Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo to portray this information."</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">"this article from 2014 on students who have been killed by Boko Haram, published by the Katholische nearest news page AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it is a" similar jihadist attack. ""</seg>

<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and does the actual horror of what actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding pictures of a refusal is equal to the recognition of the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent imagery readers and viewers are desensitizing and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media act upon helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>

<seg id="1135">"storytelling, by flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0."</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"in short, Global Voices reported a different initiative of Steven Bird, the placeable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS does not lie on the written word but on the spoken word."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has conducted events since 2015, the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, accept diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often associated with understanding" "these events" "instead" "listening to appreciate, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, histories tell their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their depiction lead to the fact that the audience is insisting on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyugara tells the story of the rabbit and the Pavian in the Zimbabwe language:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his sentence, John Nyugara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own history stories."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a new inspection of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017. the March started at the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of the debts) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a managerial committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refused to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available here royalty free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge, and what are the real costs associated with this."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and in order to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was painted out of the directory of the Adra Prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book, entitled Collective Remembrance, gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own fate, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military unit, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court out of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"his whereabouts, however, remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Basel's cultural prototypes was more obvious than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which not only represents the cultural heritage of Syria, but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip of digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and he taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">He opened the door to technology for me. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty free.</seg>

<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile at your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: head of corruption sentenced by corruption to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"with anger, Mosambique reacted to a corruption case where a government member returned to the state apparatus after half of his sentence of imprisonment on which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic who rejected the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to restore its old post as the company did not execute disciplinary procedures after its detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call this action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP) condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have introduced disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company was apparently silent, however, and did not take reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" rebellious ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has left half of it."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director doesn't have any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return to the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served itself only by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state when it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who has been summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zebete prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to Samora Machel prison not only for ever-ever-independent president but also as sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he forcefully confirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interests. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not like that. he changes tactics, but he does not turn off his ambitions. "</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar, "or" "Always" "(in Burmese) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored in order to express their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spatibse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknitted Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' like this:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it deletes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write about.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the adjacent words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(splitting legs)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spreading hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who are spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was alert to this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post" Facebook Community standards did not meet. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have begun this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "chair" "or" "inheritance curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would have a great deal of turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech, but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>

<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also stimulate violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to take control of the rampant hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition evoked tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and announce the law.</seg>

<seg id="1357">"after having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthralled because the laws on the children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who dresses a ministerial ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and based encyclopedia Wikipedia, based on the crowdsourcing principle."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share useful information and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (Nr. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform removed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"however, despite legal prohibition, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (via the locking of Wikipedia), we put all the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least check all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, and WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if in particular country Wikipedia is locked."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry, with badly positioned motives and well-washed colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that focus on Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was and I immediately started to take pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Neptune's nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know [it], for he stood by face to face [with] face to face,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sits down, we see ourselves and he stares at me through the scarf-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyysa and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should despise the norm, this practice in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a bogus court from the Indian state of Odisha and violated her family and the village community, after addressing a married relative with her name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far less access to fear if at all they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, entered into a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years Rohini Paese has been working with her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the names of their husbands according to their husbands, is a custom that they have upheld and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not commit this will be regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply entrenched that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," "If we cannot say the name of our husbands but they can call us as they want, does this mean that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," said Rohini Paese of the village Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women should never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only sneaked in front of herself, another decided to leave the whole face of frustration with him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head, and his wife could not stop saying his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law was staring at her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less intelligible and the situation got out of force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead, which shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he would do it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped working with them completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discus club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at every discus club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salami-kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, the morals linked to the saris and much more, their own pair of kurtas (upper shirts) smuggled into a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" messages from those they themselves experience, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer at the terminal stage."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" Subversion "(State Risk) after having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon farms to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>

<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or countryside?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and self-sacrifice to create this valuable land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of this, he was inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since they are better suited to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He articulates corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as it was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the critics that you should start reading the whole address of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the headline.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneasy, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said," "Singapore" "is not a country," "he obviously did not mean in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice spoke of Singapore, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - be I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, properly associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian advocate?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements made by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, but do they not defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore tends to be a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear testimonies like" "defense of the country mainly", "but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutors by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook innerly against anger when they are kept for Americans but I don't bother them."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be diligent - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" "Die Simpsons" "(which has an own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being innocuous means unobtrusive and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around you."</seg>

<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has perseveringly pursued over the past three years."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula. it is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small female with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the showroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez explains, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, she massaged them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak about Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "he says smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone, to greet them or to report about their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"on the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen area outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants, travelling through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests again."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travelers always consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair stains she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the communication, it is said that the app" "prevents access to terrorist information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police said that the app would detect and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remote-controlling their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notions of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minorities like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from mainland China, "based on Twitter, published the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police checked the residents randomly to check if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "images from mainland China" "also published a Jingwang product description, which results from the fact that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard disk of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all branches of government, government and party institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>

<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, a great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, so he went next to an electrically loaded rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed that happened to me as minutes ago.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man:" "my Lord, my father must be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk, you will be layed."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors, sometimes he hurls to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year that Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village to Palestine in which they lived as felahyeas (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with issues like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he harbors a special envy against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib examines his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as" Palestinian prisoner of the second generation "- he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan, and never before was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a man, "while he poured into water dissolved nest cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, during which time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the droplings speak lukewarm coffee and the wavots of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while Ramadan is drinking water - in order not to land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordaniens Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some of the MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continued to pursue an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be simply a rhetorical rhetoric, but in fact reflected a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib's traditional sex men moved to Leibe by abolishing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently broken, unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of" "Honorary Citizen" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravated that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "detained indefinitely in prison" "and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is well known for being shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was introduced to politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated strikingly often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where man, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were greatly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember that his comments were swept away from the context and had been censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions but only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuda, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself:" "if Abu Nui, who should work on behalf of the caliphers later, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why cannot Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that comments in social media have been critical to the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and basic frankness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions and artificially produced democracies. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting allowing Aman to be a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the hard-wagons, the drums and the dancing were taken over more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, into the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outer appearance and body care seldom have been as important as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like that of the Friseurs."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug dealers are all daily."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and the resulting hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens to go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"experts face each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdresser's art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to Guerillafighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the article" "Liebesbitions to Guerillafighters", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write letters of love to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, to receive affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Bogotree Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to guerrilla fighters from the Young Youth Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which constitutes the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace agreement was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to military rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters, to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotic Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC set themselves up as they did before, in order to accept the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours, from fear to happiness and all that lies between them, "said the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters were living) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, he was sorry to be all the years the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC gathered together for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already operating in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the state impacted upon the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "one of them said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated even only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - also those who have been killed and caused so much harm to bring us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms to rise up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that addressed the abduction, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of Chechen authorities arrested by suspicious queer men and hiding them in secret prisons in argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transfuwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she finally moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transfuwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos from my documents made the lap by WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I sensed something in my body, but I didn't hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long will you still honor the family, you Schandstack?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>

<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had taken everything and started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right pulmonary wing.</seg>

<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has gone respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>

<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running top without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just a bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster that is not just your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"it was too much for my mother, and she put a rope around his neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without notice, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe me, you're safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we don't talk about the gender balance, that's a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I really try to look at how the person looks, to which she reminds herself of her past - that is, my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed here?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told us that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">"OC Media: are you still gay men in these secret prisons, too?"</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held down there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they should be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, they were immersed in a targeted way in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this just a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about it yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already known in Grosny, when I was living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">To be in the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to approach us to" civilisation, "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wearing tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia never curbed me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you, because they believed you were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did it last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who laughed before, laughed at you once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I capped out breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to show you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which the cabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all about it - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide among the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August moved the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay for his family, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments when he lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the basis of persecution from the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, based on a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams that divert water from the Arab territories to the Persian territory, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture and the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Asturi youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have completed 45% of the university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy..." aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and be hired, since even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances given to the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, also with the intersectionalen not"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be female."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware of and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer doubly and threefold underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to talk of skin color, on racism, on black cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been subjected to racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices "and" Kumbaya, my Lord, "to reach equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men every skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which relate both to sex and on the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojours complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman in historical terms is a dehumanized and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of incision of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement stillness, no matter how many black women attempt to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word" feminism "still is in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall culture: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am acknowledged as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life is neither ignored, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article is part of the series # Porsermujer (# soflicheinefraubin) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a Police Inspector told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena showed because of mistreatment, the detailed Ada BÃ¡ez advert also availed nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women complain at all, they generally do not receive any support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to being victims of violence, are at all reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strips and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system, which is not subordinated to Paraguay's laws: good approach, poor implementation blows and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Egyms, a social science research institution in Paraguay." there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 women reported on domestic violence at the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in peace courts. here, too, 86% of the advertisements were made by women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the adverts, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman, which is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this," she declared at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or ex partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should always regret her."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>

<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment."</seg>

<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias adverts with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>

<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>

<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# foreigne)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to explain Feminid to an independent criminal offence and to punish harsher as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text was altered in a number of points in order to win the MEPs for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was denied, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and being punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original draft was intended, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must bear the victims of violence in the present time, if they simply wish to reimburse and receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient financial means:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the offense of offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse so long until abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for in cases of domestic violence to reconcile."</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section relating to reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site: for one, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of global healthcare."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to establish own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic has shown serious implications for national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the Pennsylvania University, he tested himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being movers."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not good to use in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What kind of obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and academics in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that periodicals make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" "paywall" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredding, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads it can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents do not only apply for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green colour or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition Morton still breeds lettuce, but it takes longer since its work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if there's a boulder in a river that I have to dollop.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "he says." "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salad of the Outredding variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and so can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may undertake to freely use the seed bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and can sell it." open source "breeders allow others who cross their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patrons."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seed and the ability to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seeds, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed, "he says, and refers to the ever-increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered on farmers markets, and should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seed available to others, as opposed to patent seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available genetic pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, is incessantly shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby assume that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they exhibit desirable characteristics - from those, by which their taste or color improves to such ones, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders carries more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more important than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts the view that intellectual property encourages other breeders, because" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations encourage innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it is impossible to make use of the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves, and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are required for their cultivation of massive herbicides, which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto) have patents, they manage to survive most small seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patenting:" it looks like I work with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are selling my grades in a few years," "he says." "with a patent it is protected for 20 years against competition, which makes it very easy in my opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, however, the concept spreads quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is launching an open-source seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to get to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding vary from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, stated that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, for which the official start-up should be scheduled for the next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development groups (among them Hivos, the international non-profit aid organisation USC Canada) and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, published a report. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context by which Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organisation and Blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"still, the Egyptian authorities blocked content on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist met.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored web page of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language issue of the Huffington Post and Al Jazeera's Qatar network because of alleged" support of terrorism. ""</seg>

<seg id="2728">"besides ANHRI, the blog of the Columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he wrote for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider in which also Canada's blog is located, on the other hand, is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in jail after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed his views on the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelaytah al-Sisi. and even though the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded in providing me with the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, a tried-and-tested murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles in order to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"furthermore, afte documented the blocking of vendors, through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can act against these actions in court."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian Army was deployed in the Favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"newspapers throughout Brazil are reporting gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered", "" "thieves rushes drugstores with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air coffee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in this way, the newspaper" Extra "published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced to set up a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper said the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision is not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a military rubric in a country that does not know the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper continues:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecilia Oliveira argues that violence can be called" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as witnessed in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"to call Rio de Janeiro as" the most violent place in Brazil, "according to Cecilia," 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"when we look at the morals per state, Rio is on No.16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"added to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecilia, has been emphasizing the security policy of the state for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"the founding of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death. for several years, however, the UPP has increasingly been under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quotes from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost globes. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war, or her, is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police declare the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2800">Screenshot from the promotional video.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Source: CanDoAction</seg>
<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by Assad's regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians living in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition agree on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege from Damascus, which led residents to rely on locally produced or smuggled goods by tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones cultivated in Syria, and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the divert of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because it is possible to plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghira Almeida."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of the plantation of fungi," says Dr. Leila at Global Voices. "</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around â¬12,700, but will continue to raise funds to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"due to the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began with the" "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this was done, they used a bigger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach people who are mushroom-breeding for various reasons" ": breakage of the siege."</seg>
<seg id="2825">Provision of a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">"dissemination of a culture of self-sufficiency by using food residue such as paper, tea, coffee, carton, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2827">"creation of new jobs, especially for women who work at home."</seg>
<seg id="2828">Creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes.</seg>
<seg id="2829">"he said:" "we hope to spread this idea all over the world, so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible."</seg>
<seg id="2830">We want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">"on October 21st, several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that came to the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 injured after the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galician region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country, and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of Ernst's situation: there is no fire in only 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"the whole of Portugal is burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata, (@ a _ ataner) 15 October, 2017"</seg>
<seg id="2841">Some of Twitter users split images:</seg>

<seg id="2844">The Descent tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveret of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared PÃºblico's paper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"according to PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads enclosed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy like in June could have happened again as the streets were locked very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities, who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which permitted the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," JoÃ£o Sorval writes in the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, became more and more widespread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this type."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people were seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the foundry application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the server was not able to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belonged to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat together in Ghazni province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even though his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew she wouldn't see her son much longer - maybe never again."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezbollah-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his flight, Asharaf found herself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar, which were heavier than himself, to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous voyage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf joined Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help in need twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high twin rates, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers face in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "the system" "suffers from a general lack of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres", "which are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible lifespan helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf had his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to unofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some Afghan-owned enterprises, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"the Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna, and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"Ashara's goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail sector and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." thus, they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end are stability and prosperity."</seg>

<seg id="2928">"citizen report: bill drafts from Egypt allow the shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in detention."</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration at a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">"users would have to register themselves in order to use social networks within six months following the successful legal decision on the website of the authority, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty Members of Parliament, is currently in front of the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of the Parliament submitted a legislative proposal which would be introduced in the tougher penalties for the allegation of the President or a senior official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the legislation, however, such action would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly would have been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian police, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"just like more than 700 protesters arrested in the same incident, Shawkan was sentenced to four years in prison for a trial."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, bogus charges of e.g. arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a Criminal Court in Giza released two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged with their coverage of pro-Morsi seating blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the punishments of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia has been interrogated mainly by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supports a controversial bill of law, the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accuse officials amnesty provided they return all unlawfully preserved funds."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"this document, published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation will look."</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources stating article 11 of the Tunisian press code which reassures journalists to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he joined the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to new regulations of the People's Republic of China's information office, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules it is also stated that registration will be required with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached in conversations within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"in social media, Chinese citizens have proposed to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence."</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in May, the State censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging App WeChat."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat had failed to register with the state government as the" organizer of information distribution. ""</seg>

<seg id="2962">"these websites are currently owned by web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnoblki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services."</seg>

<seg id="2966">"it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">"after this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers, which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption."</seg>
