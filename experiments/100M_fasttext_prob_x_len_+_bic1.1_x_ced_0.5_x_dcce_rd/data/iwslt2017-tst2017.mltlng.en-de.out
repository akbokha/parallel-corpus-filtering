that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegal by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA sent Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters were doing before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were years of indications that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands on Ris@@ en were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less and less .
&quot; instead of spl@@ itting and putting Ris@@ en into statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone number secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens alleged source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in his accession , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary was more convic@@ ted than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was originally developed by us , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Secure@@ x is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a possibility to mis@@ lead wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environmental contribut@@ or who warns us of the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has lead to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has station@@ ed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of childhood days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who wait for the next release , and on the next disclosed documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few people to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a matrix of Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far , who came forward in these revelations , this scandal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is true that in some U.S. states you need less information to give less information to create a company , than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip school children away .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to pick up especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister , who wanted to bring more suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked it , that all up to one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot;
none of these attor@@ neys took us as clients and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single leader politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; that may sound very absurd , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a native optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot of things to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen ways of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the USA has left behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have dra@@ fted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people to get angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind false firms . &quot;
we need leaders in the economy that get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end the transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after finishing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go for peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; As@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild stranger asleep in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sle@@ e@@ pless on toes at the door , and my bedroom door shut down . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood , were friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let us take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate shares and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
I am sure our cheese slices of cheese tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ left neighbour .
this quiet an@@ flight of panic you &apos;re feeling now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel that if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just so , who now actually has Al Gore &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you please announce Twitter that he is chann@@ eled for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to share with you some of the discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told , where did he come from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked phones !
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well thought @-@ out feedback system , confidence boo@@ sts confidence . &quot;
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to abandon negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had made their jud@@ gements before we presented them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust people most of whom are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three judgments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much one expects from them . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you &apos;re telling too little , such as &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m going on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create a design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the un@@ ti@@ ring work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had previously not been covered . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; if trust works , miracles can be created . &quot;
one of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they get books past . &quot;
they can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing come together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but to call it just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; if you travel nowadays , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of sharing their share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
were now offered residents . students looking for a stay
&quot; were taught to people whose children had moved out , incub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
we already had hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red Maz@@ da is driving past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; supp@@ ressed or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study showed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans think , most of them would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , facing the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves somehow ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock soon turned into indignation .
why should we do something like this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned away from a citizen to a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went to my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and when I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said , &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Do not be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings heard : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; understand@@ ably , the feelings were un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , and beating them free . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I got rid of the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to be able to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against any questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim .
when will we release it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces free , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people to other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts are ab@@ hor@@ ting the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or rejected by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
&quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , like K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot;
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
&quot; but when looking at them , they do not do what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which makes them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept from joining the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we accept more of an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit test persons messages in which neg@@ atively have been reported about Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood strikes against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain oneself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the dental clinic , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; when did my brother become such a young man , a young man ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we were silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed him and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , athei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I have collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had pulled courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than them .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as permitted .
&quot; looking at the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before the air @-@ package penet@@ rates into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air equipment achieves high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ tigh@@ tening structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most of the starter motors , it can ho@@ ver , and has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right properly . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it right , if all watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in endurance , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the most extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are available in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at it .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further if it is limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by making a half flying un@@ fit .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot;
we took commercial Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
&quot; hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the particularly safe machine on Broadway wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for guys like us lies the reward in development and creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy ; they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of pure energy into pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
&quot; more than 1,3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cel@@ esti@@ al life was created on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance . &quot;
therefore we call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o started a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes dri@@ lled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observation categories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ dle in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ n@@ ous dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and qu@@ aked at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nucleus of a nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
previous to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more than an eye than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things , which mean a lot to you : &quot;
the face of your child for example .
&quot; instead , we listen to specific features such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob canc@@ els her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; with them , we cannot make any simple images of objects in space . &quot;
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally listen to the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional tone change . this sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , incorporated into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; NO ONE who knows what to hear , sees this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ inch solar mass , which rotate roughly as fast as the bars of your sha@@ ver . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o lev@@ elled a wholly new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in All we can -- practical or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen , however , at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since this op@@ a@@ que are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt which we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the sour cher@@ ries for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o offers us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , to the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang himself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year , I would say , &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , what I feared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expectedly art . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; , &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; saw for playing with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , raise you to life . &quot;
Traum@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
Traum@@ job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I &apos;m doing television , in a grand style . &quot;
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days by four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars on television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else is doing that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
Traum@@ job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are now running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I say of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just going around the computer and fan@@ less , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t get dreaming about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it &apos;s like I set up troops , when I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one succ@@ um@@ bed to a high sound , running a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go on it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people accept if I declare to them the sums , that I am talking about writing that writing to me is joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began with television production when I started working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the sum is music . the sum is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a hum@@ ming , then you cannot strive differently than by size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more intri@@ cate borders , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the sum stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ stressed , over@@ stated , burned out . &quot;
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum ceased . &quot;
the sum of the engine st@@ alled .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my sum was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pr@@ elu@@ de to Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ard and the sw@@ am I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; ask yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re working , you love what you do , a bank@@ ers , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that &apos;s what the hum@@ ming feels when the sum stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question to me .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no when two things happen to me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan , and my sum bet@@ we@@ ars , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bo@@ asting , I can do nothing but watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum , the working sum , the titanium sum , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is no force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on the love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums are simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as important to me as we work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be than to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
&quot; we run around in the garden , in front of and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab my mobile .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and when my teen @-@ daughter speaks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring up 15 minutes on a piece , even at a bad @-@ whi@@ m day ! &quot;
15 minutes a day !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I leave and I &apos;m victorious . friends meet , reading books , enjoying the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; stand briefly for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes a bit and why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the tot@@ als of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life in me becomes wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out I &apos;ll catch you to life .
&quot; that is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; certainly , they have heard of one of the best known ones , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function is improved . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
history started 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain swelling and the skull pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they produce 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fo@@ etus , they provide for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they keep us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly like Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ created them at the recording stage of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ use these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ inv@@ ade the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ re@@ ared exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when it reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we passed the motor @-@ motor range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain level , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since then , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Fr . Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to complete about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is beneficial to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multic@@ entre study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at it as imm@@ utable awareness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro Group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for a true democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are aver@@ ted , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize its twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which , however , are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and bring income , with which it would be productive and income that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ lions of US dollars acc@@ ru@@ es a lot of money until it compar@@ es it to the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin summ@@ its , which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in an endless loop , would increase the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would kill him if he is grown up , &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily infl@@ ate the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the Po@@ or as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was , and is , that it appe@@ aled to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but is more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voice @-@ wei@@ ghting in questions of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually under@@ mining the policy and escap@@ ing it . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because the government can be in the government today , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is migr@@ ated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it eats , dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end it is star@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality increases , economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summ@@ its , and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
&quot; the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago , and it did not look very well . &quot;
&quot; the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summ@@ its higher , the wa@@ sting of it , and the social conflicts go deeper , as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a mor@@ bid surveillance hyp@@ e @-@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that resembles the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in the machines people serve , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it take , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from a firm to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues come from capital and from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin summ@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , particularly against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which they preferred privileged individuals and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a huge amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- the area of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; let us say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- who , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to choose denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what are the changes ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not the case .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; no one from the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy upon us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive dialogue of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to enter the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard of most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an icon@@ ography and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to choose the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium payout , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he has to make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives out stuff for nothing , do you attack , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com of four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 , and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something over the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data accomplished companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we are more and more concerned with statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in jail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not . &quot;
&quot; just as at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
it is not always the best results . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems doesn &apos;t know how to use data .
even the data most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these mistakes , data flows increasingly in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably lots of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread . &quot;
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , place this problem in its components so you can analyze the individual components ; as a branch , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they vie for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ issue you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will test it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know naturally , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
