<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegal by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA sent Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were years of indications that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands on Risen were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of splitting and putting Risen into statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone number secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens alleged source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower in his accession, but instead the judiciary was more convicted than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by Aaron Swartz, which was originally developed by us, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, Securex is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts, such as Edward Snowden, have a possibility to mislead wrongdoing. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental contributor who warns us of the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has lead to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has stationed companies in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of childhood days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who wait for the next release, and on the next disclosed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by a few people to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a matrix of Matryoshka.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far, who came forward in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is true that in some U.S. states you need less information to give less information to create a company, than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip school children away.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to pick up especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 attorneys in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister, who wanted to bring more suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it, that all up to one lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these attorneys took us as clients and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single leader politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"that may sound very absurd, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a native optimist, I see quite a lot of things to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen ways of more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the USA has left behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have drafted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "we need ordinary people to get angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind false firms."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of transparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the transparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after finishing my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go for peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Ash, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was lying in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger asleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sleepless on toes at the door, and my bedroom door shut down."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood, were friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate shares and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese slices of cheese tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left-left neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet anflight of panic you're feeling now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel that if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who now actually has Al Gore's cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce Twitter that he is channeled for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to share with you some of the discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told, where did he come from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"for a well thought-out feedback system, confidence boosts confidence."</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had made their judgements before we presented them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"not surprisingly, we trust people most of whom are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much one expects from them."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you're telling too little, such as" "Hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, for example:" "I have problems with my mother" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Great works of art in your apartment! I'm going on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create a design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untiring work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had previously not been covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, miracles can be created."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to have heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they get books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing come together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but to call it just" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of sharing their share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather than loneliness and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students looking for a stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children had moved out, incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">We already had hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time a red Mazda is driving past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"suppressed or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that Americans think, most of them would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, facing the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and finally believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet loves somehow?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had a child later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eileen. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock soon turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists..., "..." in the name of Islam... ","... "..." Jihad..., ""... bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the actions of others turned away from a citizen to a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove silently -- as deep as it went to my seat, and I was the first time feared to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said," "Be alert," "Be careful," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "Do not be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims congregate for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings heard:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"understandably, the feelings were unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, and beating them free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got rid of the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to be able to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against any questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces free, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people to other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists are abhorting the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">"the IS has so much to do with Islam, like Ku Klux Klan with Christianity."</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when looking at them, they do not do what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which makes them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept from joining the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how Islamophobia is concerned and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more of an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit test persons messages in which negatively have been reported about Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood strikes against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assigning collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain oneself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental clinic, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my brother become such a young man, a young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled my shoes off, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked him and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had pulled courage and compassion of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than them.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for hobbyists, is about to become a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before the air-package penetrates into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, air equipment achieves high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-tightening structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level. for example," "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most of the starter motors, it can hover, and has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"one such question would be, for example: what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right properly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it right, if all watch me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in endurance, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the most extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some are available in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further if it is limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making a half flying unfit.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expressions."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine on Broadway wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the reward in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy; they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of pure energy into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit up brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">"their energy, however, did not set them free in the form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1,3 billion years ago, a multi-celestial life was created on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo started a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes drilled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observation categories like Ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cradle in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a really albernous dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and quaked at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured in less than one thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Previous to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"with sounds, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things, which mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to specific features such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob cancels her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">"with them, we cannot make any simple images of objects in space."</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally listen to the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to gravitation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional tone change. this sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, incorporated into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender of sound] NO ONE who knows what to hear, sees this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-inch solar mass, which rotate roughly as fast as the bars of your shaver."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo levelled a wholly new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in All we can -- practical or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen, however, at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since this opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is hidden by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things in the first attempt which we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the sour cherries for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo offers us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, to the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang himself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried out an experiment."</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, what I feared, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly art. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, called for inexplicable reasons all" "kitten", ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" "yes" "saw for playing with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things, raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I'm doing television, in a grand style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days by four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars on television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are now running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I say of work, so that you understand that I'm not just going around the computer and fanless, and it's true when I say: I don't get dreaming about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it's like I set up troops, when I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, one succumbed to a high sound, running a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could go on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people accept if I declare to them the sums, that I am talking about writing that writing to me is joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't get me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began with television production when I started working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum is music. the sum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a humming, then you cannot strive differently than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more intricate borders, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overstressed, overstated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine stalled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a prelude to Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzard and the swam I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" ask yourself, stupid author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you're working, you love what you do, a bankers, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that's what the humming feels when the sum stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" poses a question to me.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no when two things happen to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "kittens". ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan, and my sum betwears, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of boasting, I can do nothing but watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl releases in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sum, the working sum, the titanium sum, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is no force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as important to me as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be than to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we run around in the garden, in front of and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you keep me naive, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teen-daughter speaks to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring up 15 minutes on a piece, even at a bad-whim day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">To "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I leave and I'm victorious. friends meet, reading books, enjoying the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" stand briefly for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a bit and why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my camp fire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the luckier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling of life in me becomes wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out I'll catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"that is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly, they have heard of one of the best known ones, the" "deep brain stimulation". "in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">History started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain swelling and the skull pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They produce 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the foetus, they provide for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly like Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-created them at the recording stage of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- auto transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-use these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-invade the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-reared exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when it reached a stable level of dexterity, we passed the motor-motor range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at a certain level, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since then, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Fr. Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can't need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to complete about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is beneficial to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as immutable awareness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro Group, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for a true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are averted, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which, however, are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and bring income, with which it would be productive and income that humanity urgently needs, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro zone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billions of US dollars accrues a lot of money until it compares it to the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions and did absolutely nothing except to inflate the stock markets and raise real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital are the twin summits, which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which, as in an endless loop, would increase the pessimism of investors that would kill him if he is grown up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily inflate the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for saving Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the Poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was, and is, that it appealed to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but is more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voice-weighting in questions of the prosecutors."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines brightly, it is quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually undermining the policy and escaping it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because the government can be in the government today, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is migrated to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that so sustainably decimated the animals from which it eats, decimated that at the end it is starved."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannibalised politics that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, inequality increases, economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin summits, and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back together, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">"the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago, and it did not look very well."</seg>
<seg id="952">"the lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summits higher, the wasting of it, and the social conflicts go deeper, as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a morbid surveillance hype-autocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or by something that resembles the society in" Star Trek, "in the machines people serve, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it take, how could it look like to have this" Star Trek "like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from a firm to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all revenues come from capital and from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin summits."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, particularly against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which they preferred privileged individuals and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers, you said very clearly what you think of the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a huge amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- the area of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I can say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, huge after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"let us say goodbye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- who, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it will happen abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what are the changes ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister, who after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"no one from the troika's troika, who imposed this policy upon us, confessed:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive dialogue of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the exposed centrists will be demonic and the European Union will destroy."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to enter the way of a postmodern 1930, what it seems to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong at this point.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard of most, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an iconography and describes herself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to choose the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a highly competitive industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks:" where are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium payout, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is there, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives out stuff for nothing, do you attack, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom of four republican US senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4, and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data accomplished companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we are more and more concerned with statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just as at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">It is not always the best results. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these mistakes, data flows increasingly in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably lots of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, place this problem in its components so you can analyze the individual components; as a branch, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards, "was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they vie for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "this is telling us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-issue you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will test it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know naturally, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
