Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution where teenagers are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are farming the former bottom of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows that had to be upset already because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; detailed maps , called &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ tional She@@ ets , &quot; were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian Department of Sur@@ veying , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria . &quot;
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph led the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Department of Sur@@ veying . &quot;
the position sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is found like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is the send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was created 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ Send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ part map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are no more farmers there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the judgment sheet , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; on the guest dough &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was established there in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , which is related to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called mad@@ men . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar &#91; 1905 &#93; . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 . &quot;
young people now meet in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; to the west is the football field of the TS@@ V München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered around 18@@ 56 as &quot; Main Square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is supposed to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as prosec@@ uting authorities of the state , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to give out the warning , &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white people . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring che@@ wing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Hof de fence Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on site .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Local Association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two depu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also many young k@@ itt@@ ens and housed in five apartments holiday palaces . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the president of the BL@@ H@@ V president , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much needs to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated it without chemical pesticides and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he did not conduct a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and wor@@ rying about how to continue their business , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
&quot; because of its funding , farmers often stand in criticism . &quot;
a total of 25 plots were fenced off by 11 participants in 2013 .
&quot; thus , the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total cost of € 71 500 was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Research Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a subsi@@ dy set by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the fenced area must not be smu@@ g@@ gling ( incl@@ ination above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ ght aun@@ ture project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ on Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he adopted a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the president &apos;s proposal to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he allu@@ ded to their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / Your oppressed masses , who asp@@ ire to breathe freely , the miserable decline of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; waste &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about America &apos;s importance .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical image .
&quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives bringing the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the torch should not light the way to the United States .
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; her torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is her only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle recalls a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; Scotland is developing something special &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the center @-@ runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metre runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle recalls her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also among the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being so special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech as captain is concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking Cri@@ tics About Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the sec@@ rec@@ y of voters
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him for all , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he compla@@ ined about the criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum which is referred to as officially and by those who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , wasn &apos;t h@@ asser@@ ole , but she asked about hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the govern@@ ors referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who is critici@@ zed for insul@@ ting Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue dropped last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Port had a similar impact on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers beat on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people using pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence her .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on home ground . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ etti . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study come to this conclusion .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up an own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking each year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the v@@ ill@@ inger street is in full swing and &quot; reasonably in time , &quot; says the head of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which again and again obstruc@@ ts the construction work , poses a major problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off guards is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Sk@@ ills Sh@@ or@@ tage and Over@@ education
&quot; if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ red ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ stran@@ ce in the troubled Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the fo@@ al tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink hard and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua New Guinea and the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car . &quot;
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from wave roofs , which were transformed by rust in different yel@@ low@@ ish tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; in Indonesia , Indonesia is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is worth $ 78 billion worth of wood resources . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that local military personnel and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to one single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is called in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week events happen , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
screws have intensified since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economies are coming from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it tasted the native Papua ( the M@@ om M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmer@@ man granted 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts have broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , expecting to fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s initiation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ red ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se and came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their rif@@ le @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to spin stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ red ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was to be listened to in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ v was hit thri@@ ce , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ is@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta only on the following day .
&quot; three weeks later , in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he intends to establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; instead everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody declaration of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with fierce dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ oo said that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after bur@@ ying the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday Indon@@ esian police fired up villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the involved officers ac@@ countable and withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Freie Papua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the State by spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and taken arbitr@@ arily into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice sold in En@@ red ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Papua New Guinea is rarely the capital or the necessary skills to conduct its own business in a competitive position . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far away from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on media coverage remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission for filming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most troubled provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai firing . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokesman of the Indon@@ esian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights incidents . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and pressed him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a spring , which also participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the fact that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says g@@ ob@@ i , the chairman of the tribal stock . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educ@@ ation@@ and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of an victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they will never give them justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee out of the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up in the fire alarm and at the shou@@ ting of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told a resident who took his name as George , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units cleared the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed the General Meeting with his big Davis Cup coup .
&quot; during the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was not supported by the two @-@ thirds majority of the two @-@ thirds majority for this sport . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ phrase classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President , David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not until now , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come before the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ ably smaller details : in the first round , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items smu@@ g@@ gled over the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which entered the aircraft while in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently carrying prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition and explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out in more than 1,000 people , conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents who admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently taken smu@@ g@@ gel@@ goods by airport security , and how many it would have done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gel@@ hop@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry on the safety , those who fly most frequently . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
humans are often unsure about which liquids they may carry or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electric jack El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ mined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; alongside the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on revenues and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less brilliant figure in the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly assessment : the changes made in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , its delivery just commen@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be collected - 500,000 will be 2020 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made available per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never tested production lines with maximum capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are greater delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from being run away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; as a result of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules , EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt returns to reducing emissions &quot;
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art environmental authorities in comparison to previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which was launched on October 1 , to meet the standards of o@@ zone in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions , or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp State At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , has long been a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly resor@@ ted to blocking or dela@@ ying regulation , which resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ mp regulatory shut@@ back agenda . &quot;
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al decided in Washington that the EPA administrator has stepped over its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ff proposed that his about @-@ turn in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said that the EPA accused more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take fri@@ ght seriously . &quot;
we take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive setting up of the o@@ zone rules .

&quot; in the Senate , the measure was not yet set to vote . &quot;
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA last week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Mountain Church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ arc their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg script : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent court , which belonged to the church or the patron law , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the local image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the dominant settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are reinforced by these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval equity .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; associated with this was the right to use a priest , or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two bar@@ red at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pits and chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the final resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half crashed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only today &apos;s existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the Hil@@ arius plant as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
&quot; the organisers invite the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old grav@@ ey@@ ard to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , the local leader , speaks the final word . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 am .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view across meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ lin feel particularly committed to home care such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to leave approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; association has called on &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen &quot; &quot; ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are meant to prevent &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - but it had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a lack of shape . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also declined , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council decided to re @-@ examine the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; explained a spokesman . &quot;
the circle takes them to the cause of re @-@ examining the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to current proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; following police indications , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and retailers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ theim and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre . &quot;
the commercial association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents of the shopping spre@@ e to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ tise the customers for what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in preparation there are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point out to the weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; as a result , the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well as well as sold Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the shops of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread , King had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities will take part in the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchase behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new other people were injured .
&quot; at a gas explosion in the U.S. city Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people have been killed and nine more have been injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first mis@@ ster was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of fact , the authorities suspected working on a gas line . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
Tru@@ mp put under pressure after trans@@ liter@@ ation of telephone calls to Mexico because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp requested a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president appe@@ aled to him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scriptions of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; du@@ mmi@@ es &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would leave him like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after saying Mr. Turn@@ bull . &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists carry rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ ase as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long turn on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore the silence as a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them met very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assists in the organisation of post@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life long mayor .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice .
&quot; a court physician places a blanket on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain un@@ successful for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI the black farmer tenants Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , fell down during a fight - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore wasn &apos;t from her husband .
&quot; on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual rep@@ lication of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their depic@@ tion is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a type of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview over the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chef @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ row Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ sting away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona pays the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ ing . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; said one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this properly , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with sad@@ ness , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children sit in their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per together . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in suit who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow @-@ players and then tears in their arms crying together ; the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience co@@ operates with the actors for dinner . &quot;
a white pair from Atlanta is chat@@ ting at a table about the post@@ ures with a black couple who have just met them .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that left the performance behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues to go on , &quot; she added , &quot; Today the only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ uring is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , whoever does not know his own history is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled Wagner to Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf creates a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging against a gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ eyed backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before this , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ le@@ chter posi@@ eren as rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ le@@ porters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; in Hollywood fashion , k@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ rou@@ ding a cor@@ pse in the trunk and giving the Kra@@ mp@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully beautiful Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box@@ ers . &quot;
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) will have to believe it . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with a powerful applause .
&quot; fo@@ sters , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel &apos;s rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in le@@ aner recreational clothes . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a wing@@ ed whi@@ stle @-@ concert about himself , five years later , there was great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is very happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his views . &quot;
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; a lot : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have made a SL@@ C .
&quot; and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , working with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social life . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
differently than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; amount : sure , here it is not about to calculate sti@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people &apos;s head , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been brought out of the family - you must always respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that is life . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as a further restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job breakdown , announced by General Director John Fall@@ on mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction program to cut a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after a growth of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence done by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy , and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ a@@ unch the Smo@@ ke Ru@@ le to K@@ ills
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , in which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smoke @-@ causing emissions . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said they show the commitment of the Agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth .
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of demo@@ crats and nature conserv@@ atives who are worried about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
community wants a common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council decides to set up a community space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take until the area belonging to the church is still owned by the church , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a shared space . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council plan to see such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , is made possible by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared space would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal provides for the investor to signal that in this respect it is not necessary to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , is this additive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t get so well ahead , but now you lean to the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real exchange value in the case of doubt , that is the opposite . &quot;
&quot; at the time of Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s proposal to ple@@ dge the proposed resolution , there are three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; if we make the decision so , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with auto : cycl@@ ist is thrown onto the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was caught by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police reported , the 82 @-@ year old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer road from Hil@@ den on the cycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction gave priority to him .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , however , he evidently did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic . &quot;
&quot; he met with a car , which provided a 66 @-@ year @-@ old hel@@ per . &quot;
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return van .
FC Bayern Munich must abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel of the German football record company Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to give up with the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the resin of star to star , &quot;
&quot; in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; meets the need for information for many visitors . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; request : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the &quot; &quot; Star@@ path Ticket &quot; &quot; should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star appeared stronger than another , although it was much farther removed . &quot;
it also teaches in which con@@ stellation a selected star be@@ falls and when it is best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the midst of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stel@@ ae with the individual planets , including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet , are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6,5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is well four kilometres .
&quot; while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia recalled . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we are fighting .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing takes this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be based on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed herself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the gener@@ ously praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks that the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ ners
&quot; in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. in front of the market width , probably after a tyre plat@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , had not been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the defensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ erk@@ ette should also be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a collision the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to catch up any more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that nobody joins the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain , even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the triple chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we cannot afford so many playing mistakes in the set @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a failure of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know of that .
&quot; I judged the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are , &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players on Sunday in no event .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; to date , migration sales have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older &quot; was judged . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to see if they were used sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t pret@@ end to be as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is in@@ accurate . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ ment Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three refurb@@ ishment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and it is safe to meet the schedule .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges pass over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
&quot; this is a constra@@ int , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; at the southern end of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will proceed .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger tip @-@ feeling has demanded the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
&quot; furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting area in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ ins protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of Vol@@ umes ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the leading duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ athletes , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the city picnic was originally planned under the motto &quot; Every@@ thing at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the key organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ k there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;

tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli takes place in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ mari@@ zed tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of N@@ ils W@@ ogram &apos;s jazz pioneer , classical , jazz and free games blend into a fascinating world of art . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed with huge success in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly talked about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who was ultimately bit@@ terly apart . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I did . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so I have never confused or obstruc@@ ted me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; but in the school time she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candid@@ at H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports again . &quot;
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away from competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said ILO President Co@@ e . &quot;
the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that start in London on Friday in accordance with the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; he said in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers fired in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North @-@ H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
&quot; the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ solved down@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; they called the two opposite pilots , however , as &quot; &quot; purch@@ as@@ ers of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Desert .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the families in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arms on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the opposite soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and cat@@ ered .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flying operation of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger @-@ pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance to a country of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; after his death , the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife . &quot;
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral Church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also wrote the title &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , the son of a French aristo@@ cratic family . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and have had the reputation of being the brand of corporate critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
that was just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the resolution of the Parliament met . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the surprising resignation of a Green MP from their country fraction in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 elections in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
chief of the CD@@ U S &amp; D MEP Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to take up her .
&quot; with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , the SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , is essential that the Land@@ tag reads as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s day @-@ day depri@@ ves the Prime Minister the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be examined legally properly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; all questions will be discussed in peace , if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding depu@@ ties to return their land treaty .
&quot; we , of course , assume that she has given immediate effect to her agricultural trade which she has received via the green national list , &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we greatly depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jackets . &quot;
she deliberately chose not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation within the faction .
&quot; even in the background that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate and elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Bundes@@ crat of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make it political capital .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his depu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ jackets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career plans . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at the time the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the Parliament &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to carefully watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs batch . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the job of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
trade has just as much concern for manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are transport@@ able and harmless to health .
&quot; if we exceed 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg at eggs , they are not capable of transport . &quot;
un@@ polluted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , production plants do not have immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to potentially illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of a serious incident . &quot;
is there only a lack of personnel or a conclu@@ sive competence ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and convenient food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to law . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ ted media , manufacturers , retailers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect the competent authorities to inform the facts spe@@ edi@@ ly and un@@ comprehen@@ sively .
how the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses . &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money easy@@ going , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will sign up and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the team &apos;s financing through the rich royal family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they have to counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which exp@@ ires until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , the UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P isn &apos;t dead and we will be reinfor@@ cing the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be allocated to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members were limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , who could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catal@@ onian company might sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income . &quot;
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a portion of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come on payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become World Cup ambass@@ adors , and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G via Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following the signature .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership on PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new automotive supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Cho@@ colate has produced the Swiss brand . &quot;
now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the contract .
&quot; on request of the news agency Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t reports on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will enter a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged sho@@ ck@@ boards of 14 grams , each year , distribute the flight attend@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing . &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; insi@@ der insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a shock manufacturer .
&quot; as many applicants are concerned with the new tender , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y it . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y stri@@ ves to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
chocolate tablets distribute Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
&quot; before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the business class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class . &quot;

the three @-@ time World Champion is fighting for a medal in the final Saturday .
&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic champion of 2016 , failed in national championship ex@@ cre@@ tion and could only look at the disc@@ us competition from the grand@@ stand . &quot;
&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5,@@ 13 metres far , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; &quot; The State &quot; &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd go to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children , who will grow up - nevertheless , they create the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the seat . &quot;
&quot; years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dies go more to the watering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sw@@ ings the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character is rum@@ ma@@ ging through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of coinci@@ dental ma@@ dness that could hei@@ gh@@ ten this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene shows the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , athei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregory and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dialo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy isn &apos;t fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a shot at the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials reported large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two people were arrested in Italy . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
there was a lively exchange between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four function@@ aries from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in view of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly referring to the Italian Ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on May 27 at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner @-@ register compla@@ ins
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions on asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise made aware of large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in a way that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; has occurred . &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including 5.@@ 7 million non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the data is managed by around 600 country authorities in Germany . &quot;
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts until now . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; of people who have long ceased to be alive or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot;
&quot; faulty data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics on adequate people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; such false orders , however , led &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate &quot; means , in other words , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 year old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the single travel . &quot;
&quot; the Office now decl@@ ines : &quot; meanwhile , the capacity of accommod@@ ating families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) is sufficient for these commitments .
other EU states would also send back refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the lef@@ tist fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening human rights violations in the Italian asylum system and a risk of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 liters of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available for other people . &quot;
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , ahead of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , now shares 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Council , the congregation commen@@ ces multiple prepar@@ edness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the coordinator of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K District Team Leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ ors and received awards for 50 paid blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of their life @-@ juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but she sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to brid@@ le the inflation stimulated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs could possibly exceed more than expected on the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank insisted that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; according to these news , the Po@@ und fell from the dollar and the euro . &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest rate increase and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse at first before it will improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; income departure , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; significantly &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the fall of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will put it on again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent swap rate , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages fin@@ alize , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ formative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the medicine at N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified suitable candidates who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered by a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will hold £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p , by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when directed specifically to vulnerable and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p trial is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ atively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown to me in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend down . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to place the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter @-@ important , so it is very easy to slide the door when you push the door . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical power sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square footage of something standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ als Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and the developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Jeans set up jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - from Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul in the value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first court hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some of the possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early case submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ un@@ lade of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and $ 26 million in leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire became the best friend of the television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current fight , &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our business will be dealt with by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
a new chief of staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , it will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff of staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House which he wanted to repair : poor information falling into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship to television ranges back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said the former presidential advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a constant lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mp T@@ we@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to keep away anger from him , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tru@@ mp controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to indu@@ ce question@@ able information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ makers :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tw@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has expressed false alle@@ gations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ors are still looking for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get postal by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe will send in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the most sought after criminals are not known to nature , critics of the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows on the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; advent calendar in winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting on holiday destinations hide , the name was Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 postcards for sought after criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online applications could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on evidence following the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on the foot of war who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn up by the church to rec@@ laim a field from their man@@ sions .
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ging from the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
&quot; in Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Bir@@ k@@ enhof hotel .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the then ambience company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 over@@ nights were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Coun@@ cill@@ or as a collective housing , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by installing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
&quot; but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location , and already spoke of serious prospects at the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has long been building sh@@ utt@@ les before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear that extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; very close &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the views of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; in demand for investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the external facilities are also brought to foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which is open to the public from the restaurant . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Agent sets out Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , Sonder@@ kommand@@ o Robert Mu@@ eller is alleged to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people entrusted with it . &quot;
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
the station CN@@ N reported that there were already the first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the Tru@@ mps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are expected to act as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more Tru@@ mps &apos;s private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o Tru@@ mp personally went to the Centre to investigate whether the President could have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to take the oath under oath .
&quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N , charges were already issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in the report , people who were involved in the meeting had been sum@@ mon@@ ed to testify . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp Ad@@ visor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort took part in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the implementation show that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to show the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the Democrats a way to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House recommends all measures that accelerated the work of the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not going to be as@@ cer@@ tained against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this accus@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June ahead of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
&quot; according to US media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o and his collabor@@ ators . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike an independent exhibit@@ or of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President &apos;s ur@@ gency from the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented draft legislation on Thursday that the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg dri@@ fts in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg was solved by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf . &quot;
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over one tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now dri@@ fts to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant enthusiasts who have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people .
&quot; to what extent , climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg , is unclear according to research information . &quot;
&quot; however , for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual collap@@ sing of ice cream in the region , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ err@@ ations was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete cow@@ ard@@ stick is crum@@ bling down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point . &quot;
the melting of ice cream and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice cream leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica , according to A@@ WI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approx . 200 metres . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he affir@@ med . &quot;
&quot; scientists argue that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these scientists do not return to the decline of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been very busy in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic ice surface has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the drop in temperature contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees over the last 50 years , thus counting towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ dler &apos;s day has made 41 new jobs in administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications had to be recorded for the places to be found this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &apos; wish , the administration will develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate scar@@ city . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , point out concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training initiative , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a ver@@ itable &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees who leave the ministry are affected by disease or age related problems . &quot;
&quot; the highest time for action , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s people , CD@@ U faction leader , still goes beyond the common request with his party . &quot;
he had long been worried about a big surprise when he questioned the bill of human resources and start@@ led the other parties .
people want all the possibilities to be checked that enable an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should asp@@ ire to a house tari@@ ff , &quot; says the peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials , as it actually fores@@ ees the opening of the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly stipul@@ ated , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level , oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees have to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone to NGO &apos;s rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; the organisation said in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had over@@ seen the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ entr@@ a must first of all have an Italian police officer who over@@ sees their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer climbs , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; again looking at the lookout point , connected by &quot; fu@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refresh@@ ments brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - both sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ at@@ y during wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included . &quot;
&quot; the first federal li@@ ga@@ des , who are increasingly involved in this field , have also recognised this . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot;
he is certain that there are still several clubs on this train .
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile consul@@ ts an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must , in particular , deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Swiss lig@@ aments to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are challenged at a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bery also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ bery also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming ever more a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist canc@@ els the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the consulting company Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , € 50 million has been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to reach 130 million . &quot;
&quot; with almost 2.4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez will participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department according to D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t hold on to the fact that everything stays as always in football as it always was .

Michelle Car@@ ter for the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy ur@@ ges for suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent execution by Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; &quot; no day at which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person , with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in a car in 2014 when Roy was found dead by carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , hop from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked at Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his split up his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the level could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
&quot; but the sign from the coach , Kim@@ i was able to interpret it as well . &quot;
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had grown from youth , de@@ but@@ ant and just out of vacation , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is prefer@@ enti@@ ally distributed to those who want to have a lot of fun , which you want to keep in your mood . &quot;
those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ame can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flour@@ ished as a mini @-@ steering over the field . &quot;
&quot; to the right , this is his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest . &quot;
and Kim@@ i made me feel like the one who can take the helm at the best .
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ op . &quot;
he had the sight of the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
&quot; V@@ idal tried to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches there@@ with , to make up the performance of the Asia trip ( only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not able to neg@@ atively notice their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked out quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le went along with Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game structure . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance during the debut .
&quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bayern world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new fellow players after a couple of cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New one more . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ ser Tempo
&quot; it often proved irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) or Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier @-@ based companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest revers@@ al in infrastructure : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; the West Bank of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the urgent need of the federal highway . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to start the route in December 2020 , &quot; &quot; says Ministry spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; as from Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) seeks to stimulate sales in supermarkets to boost sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of the German Wine Route for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the final exam and 2500 euros , if graduates do themselves independently within ten years of the Master &apos;s degree . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction , there are quick facts to create , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot;
&quot; so far only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to set up Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber asks for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; s &amp; D spokesperson on CD@@ U , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in obtaining country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a rating of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; ex @-@ Economy Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind @-@ force company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies , it already cleared the field . &quot;
Audi to change 8@@ 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are confronted with a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day prior to Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group president said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens , and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the car manufacturers to install exhaust gases em@@ itted from diesel vehicles also increase , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful automobile companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ switch devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but returned in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities acc@@ use Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended . &quot;
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could hardly burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefits of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los cle@@ ary n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the bu@@ ds of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still works and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughing , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he defeated himself among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
time and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mur@@ mur@@ al figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works daily for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches , his cute characters continue to find widespread dis@@ semination worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings , which has a jack of thousands as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film will talk to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of drought , and because of the diseases transmitted insects are declining , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , cause great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has an impact on the service life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ine , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have developed smaller ones , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary this year .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sin@@ alo@@ a state by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are to take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts wrote three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected of being on the pay@@ list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while in the whole country the bodies are pil@@ ing up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to began his ministry in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ ama hat . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to manipul@@ ate the cases of journalists , it has just launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ings connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists are rarely found guilty of journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez had left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez had become aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was crushed by guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the competing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the children , expecting ga@@ it members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez no further , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars to shar@@ ehol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for their courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist coinci@@ de - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what went ahead ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells bad , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who claimed the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has reli@@ ed on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assassination of brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the government spending that concentrated on the governor &apos;s home town .
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or what happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the whole century all the political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers would have viewed the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few characters and the next morning he went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; protests on pav@@ ements and buildings in organized protests .
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez has gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and sending them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re@@ grouped by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who were under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media guard group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the T@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone lay beside her separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue on how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of their Director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the cover page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trade was frigh@@ tened by him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they published the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce website about mobile phones . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren lifts nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed their traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , although a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the retained din@@ osau@@ r , which was ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has stun@@ ned researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth sounds . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ fei@@ ting , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to better interfere with its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , what signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the C@@ ret@@ ort time , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on indications of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it was eating as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland as they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just lay a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time when gigantic ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x lived for millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has died in the sea after death and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the du@@ sty arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that hung from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were s@@ war@@ med by Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater equipment kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains covering still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more confusing it will . &quot;
remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the Thunder@@ storm : mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ sions
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ us .
&quot; there are numerous clubs , kilometres long , and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ us on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information of the police at 17@@ .00 hr@@ Bel@@ ow between the connections of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm about 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was a slight to moderate injury , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , a 10 @-@ kilometer long way back was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also came on the reverse track to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing escap@@ es you sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes one uns@@ ett@@ led or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the job @-@ free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is called the ticket de@@ valuation without the conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation is published . &quot;
the train attend@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the train attend@@ ant arrives at the Y ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can sleep on , work on , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train attend@@ ant , you simply check yourself in the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of the Marketing Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train knows that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the greatest off@@ enses . &quot;
&quot; because often one has , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents that one needs to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID card is missing , or otherwise a document you have to point out . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in the control of their own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this only applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further drivers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; did Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ arded on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she used her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman took his rif@@ le and scre@@ amed : &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... all the animals . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence coming from the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the chance to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black woman child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after August 9 , &quot; she said , and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to document &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document , or do you try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt insi@@ ders . &quot;
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project together with six other natives the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ nor &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah guide but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ and &apos;s life , as they fall in love and marry their wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who , after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ man Martin in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and so we are constantly struggling on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although she was at the front front because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s news agencies have long since van@@ ished , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although they haven &apos;t been built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery moving more customers into the city , from which the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , with 13 direct marketing products offering their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will end . &quot;
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer says : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmers market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes made by the country women again and again gladly . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is that too . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing can settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
but this should not be very low with the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : what &apos;s your favourite shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are enough of that in our city .
you can see how many shops stand empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms , because the rentals there are often not tra@@ dable for retailer . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a shame , there &apos;s almost no special shops anymore and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming soon .
or does it already create the spec@@ ter bit gallery before distributing all the stores from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this simply won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ ave &apos;s prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic noti@@ fications on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gender and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ical data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , had already been openly spoken about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette but@@ chers and che@@ wing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her j@@ ailed m@@ use have become un@@ equal spectac@@ les , who exchanged several letters in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ression Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert it &apos;s judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as astonishing similarly , at least in biological respects , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic book . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how they appear with a hands @-@ on @-@ phone in the hand of the disciplinary kern@@ els of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech cold , then they won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which coinci@@ de like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
a country @-@ wide race is under way for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are sought as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call and came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and Det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ itt , the Vice President for University Rel@@ ation@@ ships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ ws had now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair which is examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ensis . &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help US investig@@ ators in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be present .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , which said that something happened in the 10@@ 08 apartment . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team at Grand Plaza has published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will take out the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are being implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the publicly funded study by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we won &apos;t give something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; the words of Mut@@ kos were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the Independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody wants to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA by carrying out dop@@ ing checks in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction , in order to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di sells no eggs for now

&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed any further by any health impair@@ ment , it was reported in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs to Al@@ di should be delivered which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ l@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and p@@ olls conducted by certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that points at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Financial Technical Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ gence , which helps companies prevent and detect poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sour@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ LIN@@ T , Conver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ Hot@@ line , which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees treat poorly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and in@@ convenient experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company deplo@@ ys Conver@@ gence , problems that were previously being hidden by managers who were in offices in cities or states have been identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ s more quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance for Venture Capital Invest@@ ors to support both start @-@ ups .
&quot; in February Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itter won $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s venture partner , and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital , these investments are hardly surprising . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors gain returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company take no action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes are not coming fast enough , or not at all , can this dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees will ask themselves , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond between employees in a sector that is well @-@ known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have stri@@ pped off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice , before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday came to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three courses of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully @-@ packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal playing preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multiple routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they chat on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which has been rejected in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the nearby Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been cast with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective network behind a door pole , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against bog@@ us messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages to third @-@ party fak@@ es and display their results under the original article , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fact chec@@ ker , which may display results of the fact test from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they fail to remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be testing its feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot;

&quot; Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cosy seat at Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ iry Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to thumb print on the page of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell smoke , because then one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &quot; ) this is all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena @-@ heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape mer@@ ges , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let it all go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se itself on a broader basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it painter who hid Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s family for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ locked . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mer@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the envel@@ oping of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Honne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand on Friday ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led Nelson Ar@@ tz to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it is said to be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the chapel at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel last night . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their un@@ folded website yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they compete with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Honne@@ f , the city of Bad Honne@@ f can cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount and the campaign costs . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises against reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is how this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting no longer took place in the building of the general staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the five Deputy Prime Minister as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the super@@ structure . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ ster of the put@@ sch attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the attempt to overthrow the &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ line ban on soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large pur@@ se in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 73@@ 95 civil servants by decree , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier .
&quot; three times , she appe@@ aled to her role as a guar@@ dian of the secular order . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform guidelines of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly @-@ called officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to get cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are spending green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for race @-@ climbing shuttle
&quot; over the past few months over the past few months have been argu@@ ing about the future of the racing engine , now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; still before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the catho@@ de track on which the tourist rail continues . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure a long @-@ term future , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the route this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; said Minister Secretary of State , Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at some 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alized , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as the operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; in this way , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this means that the racing bike shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is one of the most popular train connections between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in recent months , a pilot company has been testing whether the route is being used by a large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the circuit is strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are at the moment a great deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver lots of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from its infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it will be even more disturbing , as many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ father woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing to , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compared to a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xx ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point out to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not keep any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened in the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn body and the drawn eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , put on the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the 2017 speech : maid
Tru@@ mps a great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp relatives . &quot;
we are all re@@ port@@ edly committed to placing our filter bli@@ sters .
the power of shri@@ mps to bring together families has been less noticed .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day &apos;s bi@@ bs will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ spir@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact no Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 @-@ s and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have judged the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olog@@ ously gr@@ inning , while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was taken to hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death penalty .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ inst@@ day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four@@ thous@@ es from F@@ ingers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the primary schools will go to the secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens . &quot;
instead of a chicken @-@ k@@ ens a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken was broken , and the eagle spread forth his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders were carrying the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each one of the four@@ thous@@ es to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by thank @-@ word to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always ski@@ ps with classroom passes , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; now the ch@@ ick time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she was very reluct@@ ant to leave school , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they were able to rely on the four@@ thous@@ es . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ year students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , refer@@ enced by TV . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal detained persons was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and lay down anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the affected people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are expected to improve emissions of emissions from emissions of Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates negotiated are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
its retro@@ fit has ordered the Federal Office of Technology ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but no exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be settled into its frame . &quot;
how long will the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the involvement of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
&quot; in the workshop , the conversion itself could take only three to four hours . &quot;
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do mot@@ orists who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tells us to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; to date , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot;
the ACE tells us to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony headed by President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , already announced to refrain from participating in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; The New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to ev@@ ade them - and it bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to make clear her point of view .
&quot; the Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be in R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; the place has already been written out , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city engineer for 31 years .
and the work is still a lot of fun to him as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he wonders that no application has been met with the requirement profile up to now . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the next time .
&quot; in this way , considering the regular period of notice , there is still enough time to work on . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law , the applicant must submit corresponding conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years , some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are about to be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter will hit with some 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master in great scope .
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often cited by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the ol@@ d@@ town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the dis@@ appointing c@@ ity@@ master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is building owner , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs above my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , his successor remains for a long time , says W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed studies as a graduate engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of structural and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the municipal building office is subject to structural and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ tak@@ ings , management of urban properties , urban farm with construction yard and municipal gar@@ dener , as well as Unter@@ e Bau@@ judicial authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bike thrown onto lines : South @-@ lane closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Strasse ( B@@ 116 ) on the cables . &quot;
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are looking for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the scene of the scene , a ro@@ sy sco@@ oter and a bike @-@ driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a bucket of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ator , would have brought himself in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the engine and the installation , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail replacement goods , sponsors of rail customers could also come to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the spokesman said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten people had dropped out on Friday morning , two of them watched the traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study suggests just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
&quot; the inc@@ urable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too wide in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been discovered that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system is also s@@ wir@@ ling with humans . &quot;
&quot; post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same trunk , but had not had it separately . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bial chromos@@ omes had to be done - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells were found , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was puri@@ fied , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the quantity of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen roll as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic was , however , excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u launched in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ up XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three new commitments , but insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four , for this I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot;
Boeing jets &quot; Dream@@ liner &quot; in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the United States , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing already had such advertisement in the past .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo in the sky were drawn . &quot;
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel is still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime @-@ Pres@@ idents always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important desire of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with increasing terror watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; Mr Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions by the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber from the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising faction of a Green MP , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the state election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jacket must immediately give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election leader of the Gre@@ ens editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ gh@@ ed , when the new job message was reached on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the resignation of the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the sleeves , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after that , comrades , the comrades te@@ amed up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just got new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next stop .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD ruler , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication so pretty much that one can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ standard and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for quite some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the neighbourhood of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is basically no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Mr Schulz did not even know .
&quot; at the same time , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; her anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ jackets . &quot;
&quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career choices on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jackets is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to Parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD as a leading candidate into the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U MP fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or that there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for town III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg Urban Development informed on Wednesday in feelings . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what has happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 there have been in sensitive renovation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the restructuring area I of 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the re@@ development area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to encourage inner development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on 4 April , the President of the State of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was € 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which 500 000 euros came from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ tives . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area occur ?
&quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continues to investigate where the &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role whether there is interest in the planned area to rehabil@@ itate .
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the foot@@ bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; since 1 January 2017 , the eligi@@ bility period for the funding will remain until 30 April 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , the survey would only be carried out , as part of which the participants received a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , if possible , the declaration of incor@@ poration shall be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each municipality should carry out the above @-@ mentioned preliminary examinations . &quot;
it is a question of assessing and deciding the urban ab@@ norm@@ alities and deciding when to refurb@@ ish and to what extent .
there will also be a refurb@@ ishment note in the land register for the respective plot .
&quot; once again Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to sensi@@ bility and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it works among other things about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment prospects . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; budget and apartment arch , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; business arch &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , he pointed out that a fulfilled questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new building measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler further emphasized that the distribution of the funds after the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; works - whoever comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor op@@ poses himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that canc@@ els American production last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military designated by the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighter from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his boss , Deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew for the return flight would be needed .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation into the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dis@@ assemble the US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirements of the crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp was talking to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss about tricky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga joins the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; in spite of five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga got the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in a rather similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially in the post@@ erior positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; while the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman does not lead to the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be competing in this season at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was at the ball yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
&quot; he was to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again be put into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 . &quot;
how America can damage O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; , &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages to punish European companies who help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the local O@@ MV , together with other European companies , have been al@@ armed with the construction of the Russian eastern soul Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen itself , which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ co , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the bat@@ ches three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A focused its attention on the richest organisation of the drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal is back as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ on and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ co will start on September 1st .
role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city is organising the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
&quot; as of September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still cooking except the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city runs 46 children &apos;s day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are cared for 45 hours of the week , eat in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 partial @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , portions meal individually , give off food , clean out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are attached to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as si@@ eve @-@ rough facilities - decides the size of the ho@@ ur@@ ly .
&quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the ital@@ isation to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
children should help prepare the meal .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita premises - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical one , it says from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , though 46 partial @-@ time forces are re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 persons in the education area , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eled in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , &quot; &quot; A strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of altogether registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 P.@@ M. , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s phone . &quot;
&quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request , but went on with her friends . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;
&quot; without prey , the duo escaped . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make sure that in the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow in Man@@ agers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 people work in the plant , which manufactures hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner , Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s hopes to express &quot; concerns that funding is not being pushed forward for the modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; families have worked here and the workforce is concentrated heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is desper@@ ately seeking a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland last night , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and that applies to all of our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn against Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the side of La League likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be indul@@ ged in her persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after leaving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced its way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insisted that the club always had its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world been warned of the PS@@ G President three years ago before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign with themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to go down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately turned out a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate Number 30 and caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s disgu@@ ise of more than 200 Euros . &quot;

the police are looking for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW tour and tou@@ red the crash barrier . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was travelling on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;

the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console .
&quot; on the passenger car , property damage was created . &quot;

&quot; according to the accident victims , it can be good that the Mercedes @-@ Benz driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident at all . &quot;

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen reports reli@@ eves strain on pop@@ e Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the ab@@ uses suffered by Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue for discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesperson for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time .
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that reporting on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Heights is measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; &quot; would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , said : &quot; you like to go on to the church and that is a nice fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches had been a quite normal educational tool &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on ab@@ uses , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the mem@@ o@@ irs &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer , Ulrich Weber , entrusted to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could be even more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other defend@@ ants , many cas@@ u@@ alties concern the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tions are associated with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence practi@@ sed in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ er@@ ist and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible to the latter , when a dome set musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in general . &quot;
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; if necessary , one can repro@@ ach him , find out about it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; sky &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger present an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which led to break@@ through@@ s . &quot;
&quot; he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for many years , and he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are of course bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; so , one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just collap@@ sed on him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him are still eag@@ erly working . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot has been reported about abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger present in the final report any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said one of those affected by the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not silent .
&quot; if they did not even famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Stu@@ dents rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of ab@@ uses ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he / he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected ... to have opened more intru@@ sive or more clear or even more likely than to their parents , dormit@@ ories , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up to the affected students and / or their surroundings , they could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any co @-@ existence . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or adver@@ tised . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these atro@@ cious crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; was read at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; looking at &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and mal@@ igned , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he first got the boys to face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um &apos;s gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 @-@ 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only in 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that the test sentence will continue to be practiced in the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended penetration . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as exam@@ in@@ ers had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that just isn &apos;t right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the testing of schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis declared that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical norms to the time at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ inable and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then . &quot;
this is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally be opened .
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ears and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shown in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject test sentence also become the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XVI@@ . , tells from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen just played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not at all conc@@ eal that he conducted a stric@@ ter regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ ce , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and candy only one does not even make a great singer and before every success , like in any area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experiences again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , thorough , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something even just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with , how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , still today , 23 years after his gradu@@ ation , regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but it was also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up and rever@@ e them . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
there is the evil intent that is behind it all too obvious .
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ up area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany &apos;s probably nobody knows the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , would finally be in peace . &quot;
