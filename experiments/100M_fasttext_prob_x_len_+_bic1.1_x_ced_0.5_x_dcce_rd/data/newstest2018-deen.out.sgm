<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution where teenagers are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are farming the former bottom of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that had to be upset already because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"detailed maps, called" Urpositional Sheets, "were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian Department of Surveying, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph led the project forward, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian Department of Surveying."</seg>
<seg id="19">The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is found like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is the sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was created 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of UnterSendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller-part map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flurks from the so-called" "urine" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no more farmers there today, but small gardeners of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "on the guest dough" "or from the height" "On the air" "but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district Irrenanstalt was established there in 1858 / 59."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, which is related to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of so-called madmen."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar [1905]."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered around 1856 as" Main Square, "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Advancement of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as prosecuting authorities of the state, which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to give out the warning," "said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of civil rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Public Prosecutor, which shows that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than white people."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring chewing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling according to ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Hof de fence Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-Local Association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also many young kittens and housed in five apartments holiday palaces."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the president of the BLHV president, he described the electric fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and cultivated it without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct a bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and worrying about how to continue their business," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">"because of its funding, farmers often stand in criticism."</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced off by 11 participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of €71 500 was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "declared Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Research Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides state-of-the-art funding of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a subsidy set by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area must not be smuggling (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman's Weight aunture project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firon Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he adopted a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposal to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he alluded to their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta said," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, / Your oppressed masses, who aspire to breathe freely, the miserable decline of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about America's importance.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical image.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives bringing the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not light the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is her only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "Scotland is developing something special" "and the UK's athletics must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" "incredible" "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The center-runner Muir leads along this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metre runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle recalls her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also among the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as captain is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics About Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the secrecy of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him for all, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he complained about the criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" "Na, and?." ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum which is referred to as officially and by those who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not professional."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hasserole, but she asked about hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governors referred to as" "concentrated spam" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue dropped last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Port had a similar impact on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers beat on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people using pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Mountain Church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July, 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and patrons of Tumarc their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Wuerttemberg script: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold" the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the certificate, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent court, which belonged to the church or the patron law, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible in the local image of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the dominant settlement of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are reinforced by these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval equity.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"associated with this was the right to use a priest, or to propose a new priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two barred at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded in 1692 for the first time, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window panes were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpits and chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the church tower and half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today's existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the organisers invite the friends and patrons of Tumarc on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old graveyard to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Hartmut Romann, the local leader, speaks the final word."</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 am.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to conclude the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view across meadows to the forest," the organizers take out the fantastic view. "</seg>

<seg id="511">"a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette - but it had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf, because of a lack of shape."</seg>

<seg id="705">"I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care."</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was the right thing that irritated me.</seg>

<seg id="739">"the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration, in which states are obliged to curb the smoke-causing emissions."</seg>
<seg id="740">"the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called" ozone regulations 2015, "and said they show the commitment of the Agency to work with states."</seg>
<seg id="741">"we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners," "said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="742">"in June, Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018."</seg>
<seg id="743">"a group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal."</seg>
<seg id="744">President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Trump should boost economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="745">"however, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservatives who are worried about the impact of major emissions on public health."</seg>

<seg id="748">"in the end, the decision was clear: in two counterparts, the Municipal Council decides to set up a community space in the future retirement home."</seg>
<seg id="749">"before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase agreement for the still missing land part is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden."</seg>
<seg id="750">"although it will still take until the area belonging to the church is still owned by the church, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stemming from a private investor."</seg>
<seg id="751">"for this, there is a discussion about a shared space."</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the municipal council plan to see such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorous living, but open to the community."</seg>
<seg id="755">"as an example, the word" Strickcafé "made the round."</seg>
<seg id="756">"the decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn, is made possible by funding opportunities."</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">"the establishment of a shared space would be, as reported, Tjades, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible."</seg>

<seg id="760">"needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this additive."</seg>
<seg id="761">"if it helps: unanimously, it happens to the body."</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"Daniela's call points to the many own buildings with which you don't get so well ahead, but now you lean to the common room from the window, she says:" "I'm hard with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no subsidy, but I get a real exchange value in the case of doubt, that is the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="767">"at the time of Staigers's proposal to pledge the proposed resolution, there are three advocates."</seg>

<seg id="800">"a" "star trail" "meets the need for information for many visitors."</seg>
<seg id="801">"it connects nature, science, movement and athletic performance."</seg>
<seg id="802">The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.</seg>
<seg id="803">"in a first phase until 2018, the association plans" well-reaching installations at five to six locations "in Oberharz."</seg>
<seg id="804">"request: St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"for this reason, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the" "Starpath Ticket" "should be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star trail, the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts, for example on the physics of the individual stars," "declared the association."</seg>
<seg id="810">"they also learned why stars had different colors, or why a star appeared stronger than another, although it was much farther removed."</seg>
<seg id="811">It also teaches in which constellation a selected star befalls and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">"since 2014, the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, the highest observatory in Northern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="813">"according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the midst of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="814">Frequently from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>
<seg id="815">"since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned star werg - the planet path since 2003."</seg>
<seg id="816">"starting in front of Gebhards hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an" "extra-terrestrial" "location in Diemarden (community of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna."</seg>
<seg id="817">"the stelae with the individual planets, including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf Planet, are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion."</seg>

<seg id="841">"this fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans were asked for him," Garcia said, and later expressed herself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package. "</seg>

<seg id="847">"Garcia said the focus was to show impact, then boxes."</seg>
<seg id="848">"both said they could feel the momentum, which built up for their own struggle."</seg>
<seg id="849">This is the struggle that must be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="850">No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.</seg>

<seg id="861">"after 2: 2, andre Hoffmann hopes for the season opener against Braunschweig, that optimizing the defensive formation in Aue points brings."</seg>
<seg id="862">"with the first round of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, had not been the two opponents at 2: 2 against Brunswick."</seg>
<seg id="863">"that's two opponents too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," "says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf."</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the trierkette should also be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a collision the Fortunen doesn't want to catch up any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, it will be that nobody joins the line next to Michael (Rensing)."</seg>
<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three-chain, even after the experience in preparation with the three-chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we are in the triple chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are even better harmonizing and we cannot afford so many playing mistakes in the set-up."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but whether you can talk about a failure of a failed start, don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could be okay," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know of that.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I judged the start of the season only after six to eight days of play," "said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage against Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of an accident."</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know exactly where they are," says the defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland will be a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we have the right to come under the first six, is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue out of nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the second Bundesliga, which one has to hit from the start," explains Fortunas boss coach. "</seg>
<seg id="881">To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">"the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration verket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age."</seg>
<seg id="887">"to date, migration sales have sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person" possibly 18 years or older "was judged."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" may be under 18 years of age. ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," "he said, The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases suggesting that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person openly said that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, when x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to see if they were used sooner or later than usual through puberty."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it, we shouldn't pretend to be as if we could," "he said to the Metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is inaccurate. "</seg>
<seg id="902">"the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="907">"in April, the work began at the same time on all three refurbishment bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach."</seg>

<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">"like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years."</seg>
<seg id="913">"in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated."</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges pass over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">"this is a constraint, which is also used as an operating path."</seg>
<seg id="919">"at the southern end of the bridge, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">"the special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo."</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular finger tip-feeling has demanded the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable attached to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project prior to the work.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money easygoing, so that Neymar will sign up and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's financing through the rich royal family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their activities related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of FFP, which expires until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini 2015 has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP isn't dead and we will be reinforcing the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be allocated to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged that the team members were limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs, who could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalonian company might sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a portion of PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive, to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG via Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales."</seg>

<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members striving for a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that inflation would continue to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But she signalized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to bridle the inflation stimulated by Brexit and she said that credit costs could possibly exceed more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package, which was issued a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required to cool inflation and a" somewhat larger "scale than the markets would expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank insisted that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">"forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">"according to these news, the Pound fell from the dollar and the euro."</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations for interest rate increase and GDP increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening is getting worse at first before it will improve."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot" prevent "income departure," but she added that wages will be "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecasts. "</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the fall of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July demanding an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will put it on again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that the exceedance in relation to its target of 2% was" "entirely" "attributable to the weak pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" "in view of the recent swap rate, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner."</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mortgages finalize, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (The National Health Service) should prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the medicine at NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) taken before sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by healthcare through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics are identified suitable candidates who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known as antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered by a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will hold £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the overall potential of prep, by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, when directed specifically to vulnerable and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the start of the prep trial is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are HIV infected, and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society a step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne said. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in a way that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend down."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to place the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counter-important, so it is very easy to slide the door when you push the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will be selling the land - or as your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical power sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square footage of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco Jeans set up jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - from Paul described as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin's property has a value of $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first affirmdavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first court hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some of the possessions."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early case submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, where Colin opened the first Jeunlade of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons."</seg>

<seg id="1380">"Colin was very shy, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Eddie McGuire became the best friend of the television stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin responded by SMS, to say" I can really not say much, "because the case was before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our surname through the courts," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current fight," he said, adding that he "still hope for a solution." "</seg>

<seg id="1388">A new chief of staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, it will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff of staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House which he wanted to repair: poor information falling into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television ranges back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing," said the former presidential advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, insists that his personal media consumption includes a constant lobbying price. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump Tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times to keep away anger from him, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to induce questionable information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmakers:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he insists on finding out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Gottw.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to" be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisors are still looking for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a ditch digging from the Council to prevent their seizures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it" "useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous resident said:" they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by. "</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>

<seg id="1436">"more came last night, probably today even more."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect its parks."</seg>
<seg id="1438">I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop it.</seg>

<seg id="1440">"the numbers have increased this time, and one even saw a horse in the park area."</seg>
<seg id="1441">"a spokeswoman of the Solihull Council said:" "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and cooperate with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible."</seg>

<seg id="1444">"in Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise becomes"</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made up of the former Birkenhof hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the then ambience company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnights were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Councillor as a collective housing, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by installing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location, and already spoke of serious prospects at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels, managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt building.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former hotel Birkenhof has long been building shuttles before the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear that extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were pulled out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "very close" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a higher inner city level, Scherer emphasises."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set up broadly, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The views of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"in demand for investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external facilities are also brought to foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, a large terrace is created which is open to the public from the restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: U.S. Special Agent sets out Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Sonderkommando Robert Mueller is alleged to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee has taken up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people entrusted with it."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully interfered with the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trump election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are expected to act as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more Trumps's private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Sonderkommando Trump personally went to the Centre to investigate whether the President could have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called Prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to take the oath under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the transmitter CNN, charges were already issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, people who were involved in the meeting had been summoned to testify."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"besides Trump Jr., Trump Advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his dam leader Paul Manafort took part in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the implementation show that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to show the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the Democrats a way to" feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also usually works in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House recommends all measures that accelerated the work of the Sonderkommando in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not going to be ascertained against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this accusation, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has hindered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June ahead of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to US media, the White House collected material against the Sonderkommando and his collaborators."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent exhibitor of the congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's urgency from the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that the Sonderkommando could no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg was solved by the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, which weighs over one trillion ton and 5800 square kilometres, now drifts to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant enthusiasts who have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent, climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg, is unclear according to research information."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual collapsing of ice cream in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhos.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhos is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and aberrations was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete cowardstick is crumbling down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelhos is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice cream and iceberg does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice cream leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Larsen-C-Schelhos is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approx. 200 metres."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records," he affirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argue that the Larsen-C-Schelhos will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these scientists do not return to the decline of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula has been very busy in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The drop in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years, thus counting towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant jobs, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the Kreidler's day has made 41 new jobs in administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>

<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications had to be recorded for the places to be found this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the parties' wish, the administration will develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to cover not only short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate scarcity."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate internally and externally, point out concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training initiative, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a veritable "competition of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, a high number of employees who leave the ministry are affected by disease or age related problems."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"the highest time for action, so that not even more places remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter's people, CDU faction leader, still goes beyond the common request with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been worried about a big surprise when he questioned the bill of human resources and startled the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be checked that enable an exit from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aspire to a house tariff," says the peoples. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials, as it actually foresees the opening of the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly stipulated, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level, oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees have to take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone to NGO's rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," said Interior Minister, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "the organisation said in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised, after collecting all the information and assessing the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had overseen the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can shut down so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventra must first of all have an Italian police officer who oversees their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" significant changes or disabilities "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organisation is Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga caters for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being sweaty during wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"the first federal ligades, who are increasingly involved in this field, have also recognised this."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by FC Schalke 04 and finally VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttger. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is certain that there are still several clubs on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen meanwhile consults an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must, in particular, deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, you could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Swiss ligaments to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football simulation FIFA are challenged at a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the performance is certainly getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbery also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses, which can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick responsiveness."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobbery also sees problems:" doping is becoming ever more a topic. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist cancels the high integrative effect of the e-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consulting company Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, €50 million has been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to reach 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"with almost 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already on.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"according to Dutt, the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sport department according to Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB-board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June for negligent execution by Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has shown no remorse." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance that they totally regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there was" "no day at which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pain, which we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person, with whom I have been together since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in a car in 2014 when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carters revealed messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, hop from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told Carter's attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press of the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder at her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail. "</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardised because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn. "</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the service life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicaine, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil is not only tempting for tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said," "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have developed smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are to take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts wrote three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of being on the paylist of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite from violence, and while in the whole country the bodies are piling up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto began his ministry in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panama hat."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to manipulate the cases of journalists, it has just launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killings connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, journalists are rarely found guilty of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez had left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez had become aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was crushed by guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the competing cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the children, expecting gait members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez no further, following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars to shareholdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors-Cabot Prize "for her reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez gained the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for their courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist coincide - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what went ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells bad, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who claimed the governor himself as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has relied on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the government spending that concentrated on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or what happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all the political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the Valdez column as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few characters and the next morning he went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" protests on pavements and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez has gone away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and sending them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is regrouped by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who were under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media guard group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Tetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone lay beside her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the cover page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admitted that drug trade was frightened by him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with tapenrivals and security forces near the Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the board, they published the news on the Riodoce website about mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren lifts nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed their traces."</seg>

<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miners were so well preserved that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the retained dinosaur, which was ever found, and one of the world's best dinosaurs. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved condition has stunned researchers, which describe it as" really remarkable ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth sounds."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that these herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfeiting, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to better interfere with its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, what signals that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the Cretort time," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on indications of his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it was eating as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland as they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just lay a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk-time was a time when gigantic theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex lived for millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has died in the sea after death and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the dusty armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swarmed by Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater equipment kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains covering still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it will."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards."</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it via the app of the railway, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>

<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the ID card is missing, or otherwise a document you have to point out."</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retarded on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched on the street and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She used her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video she said, another policeman took his rifle and screamed:" I'm going to kill you... all the animals. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience coming from the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the chance to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ferrell and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after August 9," she said, and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black churches. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"one question came Ferrell in mind:" do you want to document, or do you try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt insiders."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project together with six other natives the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browning's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrnor's experience - to show that the movement" is not a Messiah guide but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrand's life, as they fall in love and marry their wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that in this work and in the humanisation of black people there must be a certain vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayman Martin in 2012, marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly struggling on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, she insists that" this is not an affirmatical type of action, "where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although she was at the front front because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, Ferguson's news agencies have long since vanished, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory, since she went to Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although they haven't been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents are building a gallery moving more customers into the city, from which the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will be bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, with 13 direct marketing products offering their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer says: "we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmers market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes made by the country women again and again gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is that too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"in particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing can settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this should not be very low with the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: what's your favourite shopping centre in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of that in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops stand empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms, because the rentals there are often not tradable for retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it's a shame, there's almost no special shops anymore and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"first of all, where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create the specter bit gallery before distributing all the stores from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "this simply won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping centre, which is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leave's prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic notifications on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called a Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomical data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, had already been openly spoken about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts like cigarette butchers and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her jailed muse have become unequal spectacles, who exchanged several letters in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" Suppression Images, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert it's judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature (the" i "in her surname is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence, a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishing similarly, at least in biological respects, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic book."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how they appear with a hands-on-phone in the hand of the disciplinary kernels of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech cold, then they won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacres, which coincide like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" "2, Manning Stature), in which her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">A country-wide race is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Laws (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as reported by the acts of the District Court of Cook County."</seg>

<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities will help find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, which said that something happened in the 1008 apartment."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Laws and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger days, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat at Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophairy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says melancholy."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only reacted to thumb print on the page of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome") this is all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena-heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape merges, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey "and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let it all go!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse itself on a broader basis in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says. "</seg>

<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford. "</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlocked."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver lots of them and we will see them much more often," "Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from its inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will be even more disturbing, as many robots possess the" personalities "that would make a stepfather woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing to, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"RoxxxGold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the site of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, disturb one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator on his website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxx?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point out to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not keep any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened in the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most dreadful aspect of television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn body and the drawn eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, put on the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>

<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day's bibs will no longer repel us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump are in fact a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2495">They are expected to improve emissions of emissions from emissions of Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will be in Rente next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place has already been written out, but suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city engineer for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still a lot of fun to him as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, he wonders that no application has been met with the requirement profile up to now."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, considering the regular period of notice, there is still enough time to work on."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law, the applicant must submit corresponding conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but closeness to the city is important to the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years, some important projects have accumulated to look back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city livable," he is sure about the construction office and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen park are about to be initiated."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the KinzigBridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will hit with some 1.5 million euros to beech," "if we do it right," "says Wacker."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is available for a city building master in great scope.</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs's own building yard and gardener, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often cited by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the oldtown stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits in "when new buildings are approved, emphasises the disappointing citymaster."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister bears great responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is building owner," "in the end everything runs above my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing so for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, his successor remains for a long time, says Wacker:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should have a completed studies as a graduate engineer or bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of structural and construction planning."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the municipal building office is subject to structural and civil engineering, construction planning, undertakings, management of urban properties, urban farm with construction yard and municipal gardener, as well as Untere Baujudicial authority, including monument protection."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike thrown onto lines: South-lane closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line crossing in the area of the Leoben Strasse (B116) on the cables."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and are looking for them since the night hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the scene of the scene, a rosy scooter and a bike-driver had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a bucket of Lausanne," said ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch on the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrator, or the perpetrator, would have brought himself in great danger and jeopardized the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the engine and the installation, as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail replacement goods, sponsors of rail customers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south track could be led without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"just under ten people had dropped out on Friday morning, two of them watched the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall out, but they had delayed."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study suggests just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too wide in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been discovered that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that bear a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is also swirling with humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same trunk, but had not had it separately."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference between the intestinal microbial chromosomes had to be done - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells were found, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was purified, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the quantity of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2623">"as the wind turns: as Sigmar Gabriel is still SPD leader, Social-Democratic Prime-Presidents always looked for Berlin with a certain concern."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"only no fire from the party centre, but no headwind from the Bund, was the most important desire of the election fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt-House with increasing terror watch the events in the SPD-governed state capitals."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"Mr Schulz from there since the beginning of the year, would not even be described in the approach."</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were failures.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one by one.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"according to the surprising ending of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions by the SPD and the Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red green can simply not rule reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber from the German editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">"the surprising faction of a Green MP, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), has plunged into a serious crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the rebellious Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Tjackets to give back their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tjacket must immediately give back her mandate," "said the Federal Managing Director and election leader of the Greens editorial network Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"that must not be true," "an SPD election fighter sighed, when the new job message was reached on Friday morning."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the resignation of the Green MP Elke Tjackets to the CDU without their own government majority."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, no more, the comrades soothed at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then - and everything became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the sleeves, the Düsseldorf-Pleite blew the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the weeks after that, comrades, the comrades teamed up again."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just got new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next stop.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD ruler, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he was sitting in Elbphilharmonie, while his city was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he did everything wrong in crisis communication so pretty much that one can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"due to the VW-standard and its role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for quite some time."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried to set accents in the Confederation in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover, to expand his power in Berlin, did not remain hidden in the neighbourhood of Martin Schulz."</seg>
<seg id="2657">"they let him grant him, as they spoke of Weil a stabilization of the party."</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"in doing so, Weil is basically no fault in the party-internal constraint of the Lower Saxony Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Mr Schulz did not even know.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"at the same time, the comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"her anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all on the apostate parliamentarian Tjackets."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is intolerable and democratic as Mrs. Tvests puts her own career choices on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the Party Left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Mrs. Tjackets is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but has been elected to Parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, laments a" undemocratic manoeuvre. ""</seg>

<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the restructuring area I of 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was at least 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the existing renovations are a" success project "- it is finally important to encourage inner development, not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on 4 April, the President of the State of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount was €833 333, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest of the community sensitives."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area occur?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"so Schindler continues to investigate where the" "real old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role whether there is interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the regional boundaries could be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the footbridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the federal programme" "Social City" "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"core of the program are the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions, and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"since 1 January 2017, the eligibility period for the funding will remain until 30 April 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"however, until September this year, the survey would only be carried out, as part of which the participants received a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, if possible, the declaration of incorporation shall be carried out in order to begin with the renovations in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that each municipality should carry out the above-mentioned preliminary examinations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is a question of assessing and deciding the urban abnormalities and deciding when to refurbish and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a refurbishment note in the land register for the respective plot.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"once again Pietzschmann will come back to sensibility and get a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">A key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"for this reason, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "in which it works among other things about the structural condition and the refurbishment prospects."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" budget and apartment arch, "information on size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "business arch" "can only be filled out if the premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, he pointed out that a fulfilled questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new building measures are not eligible for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler further emphasized that the distribution of the funds after the" "greyhound principle" "works - whoever comes first, grinds first."</seg>
<seg id="2705">You can't reserve funds for later. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that cancels American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military designated by the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his boss, Deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m., and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew for the return flight would be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the" "Made in America" "event was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"however, their use only for a photo-operation is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation into the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is delighted with the show" "Made in America" "- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to disassemble the US President in the White House with precise centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted at the training requirements of the crew for the month, said an official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week, which are produced in America," Spicer said. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter, when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire brigade."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump was talking to representatives of Sikorsky and joking with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen will continue for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication to the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that reporting on violence at the Domspatzen Heights is measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that" "shameful and shameful acts" "would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, said:" you like to go on to the church and that is a nice fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "punches had been a quite normal educational tool" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on abuses, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memoirs" "My brother of the Pope" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is written in the 440-page report, which the lawyer, Ulrich Weber, entrusted to the Enlightenment with the Enlightenment?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, punishment for the students could be even more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other defendants, many casualties concern the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive recollections are associated with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence practised in the Regensburger Domspatzen, "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who became tangible to the latter, when a dome set musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg Ratzinger is in general."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-existence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"if necessary, one can reproach him, find out about it too late or have not taken first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" sky "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger present an excellent testimony, describing him as" warm hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" always surrounded by the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to breakthroughs."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he was deeply regretted and apologized for many years, and he was deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, these are of course bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"so, one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just collapsed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still eagerly working."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot has been reported about abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger present in the final report any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said one of those affected by the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even familiarize themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuses?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he / he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected... to have opened more intrusive or more clear or even more likely than to their parents, dormitories, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report concludes with the very clear result:" "that in the run-up to the affected students and / or their surroundings, they could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any co-existence."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or advertised."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these atrocious crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violence" "was read at Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking at" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and maligned, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he first got the boys to face when they were already at the gymnasium's gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, like most witnesses, the subject" preschool "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the reproach remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970-71, when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that the test sentence will continue to be practiced in the preschool. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended penetration."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as examiners had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the testing of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis declared that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical norms to the time at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" trap of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am glad that it will finally be opened.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. ears and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, he has also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger shown in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also become the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells from his perspective, that the Domspatzen just played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he conducted a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trance, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy only one does not even make a great singer and before every success, like in any area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experiences again and again as a wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do something even just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with, how many former Domspatzen, still today, 23 years after his graduation, regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but it was also a lovable respect, to which they still look up and revere them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, clearly: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the media scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-up area, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany's probably nobody knows the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally be in peace."</seg>
