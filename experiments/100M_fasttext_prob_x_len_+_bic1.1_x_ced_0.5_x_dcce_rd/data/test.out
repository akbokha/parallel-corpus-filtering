28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had his dream job six months ago as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a tight family and we will sor@@ ely miss him , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank was initially living in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; to combine his style with his family was to cook something for us , to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lighted every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the Hin@@ rich@@ stel@@ ef@@ on of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston not always has to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; I will always be plu@@ gged into drawers , or I get stuck from outside label , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , pre @-@ TV with a relaxed rub@@ ble and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she raises the question of the desire for a child : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as an all @-@ embra@@ cing mother of two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career eventually ended . &quot;
&quot; Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournaments , again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he let himself lead with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; the first time in Aachen , and therefore also with CH@@ IO , was a long time . &quot;
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sport aid handed the man from An@@ hausen within the frame of a small gala the Golden sport pyramid .
the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man does not lack awards .
&quot; silver bay leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already ad@@ jour@@ ned him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means very much to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the tw@@ o@@ fold US Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger received the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wers Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the ro@@ wers Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official tour , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; on the other hand , however , the two US presidential applicants are on tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; wants to remain small in doubt and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death .
&quot; he himself would be completely different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will go back to massive regul@@ ations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore taxes on the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost elo@@ qu@@ ently . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tru@@ mp , there could be no party internal discussions . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil extraction is also to be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to cancel it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure , but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ acific trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , both of the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid even better , says Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
his critics regard him so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope @-@ makers to Europe , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women there are other reasons for escap@@ ing : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , mis@@ lead , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this results in roughly 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the Munich North , traumati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot;
many women are accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t know to help , it only needs more accommodation for them , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , only wing@@ ed women are not lod@@ ged separately , &quot; says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be lod@@ ged separately from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is lacking or are taken together by men and women , it can become more and more permanent - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel this need of protection , one can read at the rush that the house is in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new employment campaigns
representatives of the assistance physicians have called for their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns of the contract .
assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; to problems , leading to the fact that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns that commen@@ ce at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes have led to the fact that assistants of this year were quar@@ r@@ elling six times , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , with the agreement that the agreement should be beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated ball@@ room of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was sli@@ pp@@ ily , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if it had never happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was inc@@ iner@@ ated .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen Russia back .
&quot; the crime was even greater , as it was perpet@@ rated by a supposed friend . &quot;
to rebuild the ne@@ sting is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , which would be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could win a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clearly obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after having been dismissed by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in the past month . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ o@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , since its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is considered a weak response . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge over the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded assistance for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
&quot; the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that feel bad and badly treated by the West and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it might be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have stri@@ pped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey kno@@ cked out the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Board of Management , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to focus more on national marks .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands .
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and these stamps would have launched .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori ensured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ee when he brings victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ b@@ ysi@@ ze had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only few reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enthusiastic for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already brought 6,000 prizes if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has won almost 30 years of winner , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat@@ race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ or@@ rich Seven in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that without giving reasons , Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed as his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) , that later he was the Director of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Regi@@ ment staff . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Ser@@ yo@@ z@@ ha Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin , working as he worked for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile on the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president to lead the Russian environmental policy once met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - job for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia since a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his termination . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how Gib@@ son &apos;s character emerges from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published in a later date , according to the ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love the Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible anymore . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and , above all , the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth staff will be scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ iced out by a fountain fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , on Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 s@@ lashes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings are built . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete casting for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is the future @-@ oriented high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North @-@ tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the north feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; three men are lucky enough to be alive , after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat spinning around and set the worst off , &quot; said the leader of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds blowing the boat out of reach until we left the boat , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boar@@ ded without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ ating engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the offen@@ ders .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother . &quot;
this was then al@@ armed by his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sh@@ ook his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds for Braunschwei@@ g@@ gers cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : future investors should be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next council session , the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if anyone wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be identified as social housing . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also be built on the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such farms , but as 20 per cent of the dwell@@ ings as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so viol@@ a : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; no matter what , as viol@@ a , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get specialists .
&quot; however , the programme is not entirely complete : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one reconci@@ le the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be bought out b@@ ind@@ ings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ considered to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
&quot; because in the western city , deadlines are running at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be picked up there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , one removes from the objective of the so @-@ called agitation . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens count on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games , and finally on smartphones . &quot;
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest declined before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons , who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation playing the game , when she was younger , joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5.000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who exercise 30 minutes each day , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who will play Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; get out of the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
anyone who regularly plays sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the miracle at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y game cor@@ rup@@ ters who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it do ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit enabled us to pursue our activity earlier , they did not give us any reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ emon success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people to hunt , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Che@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast en@@ cla@@ ves on Thursday to the multi @-@ fight title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the solo competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and the fifth , while reinfor@@ cing her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected her final examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they each won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle female of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , a retired team coordinator . &quot;
&quot; although it insisted that during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led easily through two turns , the picture ble@@ w . &quot;
Sweden Bar and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as they expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her book book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team cap@@ itali@@ zation , which is called by the Americans &quot; grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her ground exercise , she threw the audience into the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in serial kill@@ ings while listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder was not the result of a rob@@ bery scandal , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in the His@@ panic residential areas and two more were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was cord@@ oned off on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the fe@@ west of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I did not create that . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let myself be left on that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband , Vincent and her husband , has been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to see her and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first reply was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has thought out for &quot; Please sing something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I always asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; for a long time , I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis anymore , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice to mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday . it is expected throughout the Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floods their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that inquiries for flood boats , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had demanded tens of thousands of sand bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these streams only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest booth at 09.@@ 00 on Friday at 09 : 00 . &quot;
b@@ ail@@ out teams still inc@@ ri@@ minated people from flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek water , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the nearest fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been completely su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ ess@@ on in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches which now both were flooded .
&quot; the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were washed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were set up in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; L@@ acy Land@@ sc@@ aled from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison &apos;s count@@ ability said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as being flooded , but no reports were reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water at places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; pun@@ ched by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation . &quot;
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by balls , &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe this .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared with the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether there could be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with apparently having come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , re@@ wound the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a perpet@@ ual struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there have been several armed warri@@ ors who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , the police station in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket at the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I propose to myself under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ity in the Tur@@ ning and that is for more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is the Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic med@@ alist and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ ula routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but it does not look like gymnas@@ tics in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the nearest Olympic team will have only four tur@@ rets in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns are an expensive sport and that Tur@@ ner is primarily in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we must au@@ gment the churches au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
I founded my cycle of 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( above all black and His@@ panic ) and train national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gold and thank you , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
resident doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 resident practitioners who voted for a vote declined . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS had found itself in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be damaging to any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first investig@@ ators will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend contributions in order to improve the maintenance at times of time . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ ants announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current crisis crisis and will admini@@ ster it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks have met with the government for ad@@ versaries and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of the resident doctors .
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 terminals , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike track . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Emplo@@ ye@@ es , called for the assistance physicians to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working campaign measures do not achieve anything but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare only worries , need and inter@@ ruption for the patients , care@@ gi@@ vers and their families . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health , as well as other mini@@ stries , responded positively to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training lessons , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug once advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls forming the plaque .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ utter that c@@ logged blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the cat@@ en@@ ary draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals who suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; through a provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness allows election fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man removed a government report about corruption out of office . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today disclosed .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally interfer@@ es with police , election observers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of abuse due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an ant@@ ac@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral circus to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a reference to themselves , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply name his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes to apply not removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they release their voting votes to prevent someone choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against election fraud , but also serves to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral scandal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special dish decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses one another .
Sir Eric said there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter election - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding expressions to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensi@@ tivities in eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists work post@@ nat@@ al documents to stop &quot; &quot; pick @-@ up &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
use non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists deal with full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ated by in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually assert that voters go to the bal@@ lot alone .
&quot; Sir Eric drops over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no criminal complaint was placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check checks &quot; &quot; of the election registers of the Town halls . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are advised this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T except the border and the band who proved to be an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year old Olympic gymn@@ ast is by far not the only one to have gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you may believe the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the race track , many people in the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy said to the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking resem@@ b@@ lance between the British Wei@@ t@@ len@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is to be able to pass through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to be an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities .
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese float &quot; like a pig died &quot;

&quot; the Canadian station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when he had his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor staff@@ el . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who had been brought on board in the comment team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; &quot; colour &quot; &quot; could be heard : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went down like a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming relay 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor jer@@ k , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
spectators in the whole of Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China , &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the I@@ di@@ ot has not capit@@ ulated that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m outdoor swimming relay for women as described : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was fast and hard at which many were talking about him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formulation , sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the Not@@ ice about Twitter &quot;
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC cop@@ ed and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . By@@ ron does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming relay in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly adver@@ ts under@@ wear in the midst of business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the situation worse , she looked up as she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf again . &quot;
they continued browsing and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put it back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went out and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to bother to see someone watching - or thinking about the person who would under certain circumstances buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the clothing from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and not washed her .
&quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer to your predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; when approaching you from behind , then you should turn around as a first so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him with his knee in the bar and twist while the aggres@@ sor jumps from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; in the case of attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist them so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , place the weight on the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and fix the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how there is Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ bery it is the saf@@ est to pass your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ bles his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and saus@@ age lex a serious test by li@@ cking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k pushed his course on a euro note , a ra@@ iling on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
before the removal of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to be embark@@ ed on .
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of picking up the flush @-@ button of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he cli@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail@@ roads to railway stations to washing bays of toilets , the task was definitely put under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to fulfil his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands amounts less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to leak after its lumin@@ escence was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I &apos;ve put in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will do nothing here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &apos; Let &apos;s call us Ian .
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to dock it and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they should at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irre@@ parable state . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed lam@@ enting holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was a night@@ mare for people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is likely to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family added , street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ fe and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the property in which drugs were traded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ zed them and their partners forci@@ bly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the delegates were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t rebu@@ ke anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the out@@ stretched side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the tenants have agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after having been acqu@@ itted by the owner of a class B drug in commercial intent .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will del@@ o@@ ze tenants who do not keep themselves in the house order
&quot; by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , Angela C@@ row shared a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal in panic after a ti@@ cking military jet flies to the beach
&quot; sun@@ ba@@ thers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ gal P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air strike forces put an incredible plane flight
&quot; the air strike forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety hazard occurred &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ cking jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal near the beach in Av@@ eiro .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the dining gear , without first seeing what came on them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the airplane was falling down on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force reported that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the jet , due to the bad visibility due to nearby area fires , flew lower than usual , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time endangered . &quot;
&quot; this summer , land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people were killed on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke , which limits his view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later in Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must ren@@ ounce to Ne@@ ym@@ ar in the balance of power with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europa League champion , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a b@@ anding in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing in Barcelona for the status as number one . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique has so far refra@@ ined from having a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications is the first step forward . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , who was humili@@ ated in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know about S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ fan@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; Sevilla , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat to di@@ gest in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ scop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far 11 successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot;
Ma Long in an own league with table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; thus the World Cup List first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and eben Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title to each other .
&quot; for the third time in a row , a Chinese would get the single title in the mark of the Five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the olymp@@ ic st@@ alls was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had gone back to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests on their own in fair competition .
&quot; the matches to this place I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly single @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang on only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , it did not develop the expected ro@@ using match . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , sufficient stunning ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ di@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had a rift @-@ injury , was then in medical treatment , had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympia @-@ Fourth in similar high table @-@ tennis . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp gives away &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has given short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the present Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced concerns such as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 rivals in his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , there are doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; due to false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sni@@ pp@@ et again . &quot;
w@@ ack@@ ering republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June 2012 , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the sender , CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; whether it will be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he makes nothing else but &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , Tru@@ mp has said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger for Congress . &quot;
Olympics : three sc@@ ams on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C to investigate the case in order to enforce its own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokesman announced . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; stated it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ uson , the test and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tic delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested at the airport of Nairobi on his return . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing tests , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Olympics , it was un@@ common that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on African land before the summer events in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports by the ARD , accus@@ ations have repeatedly been made that in Kenya dop@@ ing tools are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this sport has been systematically and systematically absorbed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra led by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she reminds herself of melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously propor@@ tioned person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in every movement , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ cans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are exactly as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London &apos;s school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the guarantee of Gar@@ land since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia Supreme Court .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain amount of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ per workers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works together with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distinguishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that the calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we must return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classic nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts on mass flight
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard for@@ war@@ dness of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; Association of Agriculture . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with stra@@ its several months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the vain put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities . &quot;
that is why Erdo@@ gan hopes to raise the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
he insisted that the federal government was &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in the past months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition parties . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on numbers from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum @-@ holders in Germany against the coup in front of the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as holders of asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , it is not those that are worthy of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum Rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;

strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Sunday election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not stupid than until now : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that bites itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on the island of U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a local , so should not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and counting on the end , only troubles@@ ome . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of cooking . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost invisible election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spread roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ey got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame at the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; We create das &quot; have spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which presumably will cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is when at the wrong time you make an election campaign . &quot;
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circuit is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s no pity anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U does not depri@@ ve of the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that in the country , you have to push the base away that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the pages of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election campaign co@@ ke to his comrades , however , is self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called up his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats finally lay behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the land tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely move their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; calls it the chairman Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for indigenous vocal ch@@ ords among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
&quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ remedi@@ ation : restaurants suffer from obstruc@@ ting
there is nothing to complain about on the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only end at about 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; it is also commen@@ ded to meet those responsible for the construction of those responsible , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has moved south@@ wards on Monday and the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dy@@ nia has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the village has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now go on both sides of the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ dingen .
passing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable discomfort , &quot; says the deputy head office manager Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many villa@@ gers were looking for themselves and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
&quot; what led to the fact , that some trucks in residential areas were getting fran@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; since the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ tures , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been flas@@ hed .
the fastest one was at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 renovation has led to sales arri@@ vals in them , everyone is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; the run @-@ out &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily captured are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the clients were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
it points to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; street painting has been &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt stated on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , it also has to carry the disadvantages resulting from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
&quot; for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot approach , it is also very nice elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the fact that his pedi@@ gree is back again after the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of comb@@ ating terrorism , it is constantly scre@@ wed in laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promise .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior , in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participated in it .
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the side of the results and reached a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère did a little bit of time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some are already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapon rights .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will launch a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and knock the jihadi@@ sts into the German passport with double nationality . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; cle@@ ars the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; he still holds this to be reasonable and does not demand anything , which has no chance at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning a quick method for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to incar@@ n@@ ate people before deportation .
refugees who are specifically brought to the country should check their smartphones before and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of Dul@@ les for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to pose some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some of them still work un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly and leaves un@@ answered questions .
&quot; and with some points - in the case of un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; and things that people deeply concerned , did not allow themselves to be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has moved into the focus enormously .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral competitions . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the European Union and the SPD are increasingly placing themselves in position on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties it went high . &quot;
&quot; only a fight against the equipment of the federal police , then about a security policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double nationality . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also struggles here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double @-@ pass , he keeps nothing . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
to re@@ open it is not meaningful .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in what to worry about .
but the SPD is currently attempting to pro@@ filed itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first of all sign@@ al@@ ises cau@@ tious conversation and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen gets off lightly . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it is not in all markets .
&quot; in the recall campaign , there are vor@@ tices about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year with the deliveries of deliveries .
&quot; despite the diesel , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales , as reported in the Da@@ x company . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1,@@ 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , were 14 percent lower than the prior @-@ year figure . &quot;
deliveries in the home market Germany sack@@ ed almost a sixth .
&quot; chief Executive Officer , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , the &quot; changed economic framework &quot; has given a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , where the exhaust @-@ gases first escal@@ ated , a min@@ us also continues to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony has already got off lightly through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition drop of 0.@@ 9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler further showed a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust gas testing with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the upgrade , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car has a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; certification after the conversion , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason are legal off@@ ences .
&quot; the &quot; Focus , &quot; reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot;
&quot; last Monday , this was confirmed by VW @-@ representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my commission of inquiry and of KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; explained Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion will not take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle parameters remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers can come into a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage which has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal , it is necessary to ins@@ ure with regard to possible guarantee regulations , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I don &apos;t use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands fine interest from wealthy savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking account or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers would &quot; &quot; do not have to worry about paying pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot;
&quot; do banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to return from private and corporate clients to deposits over 100,000 euros on checking account or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million € 4,000 . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the costs now continue . &quot;
&quot; leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the Co @-@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ er- and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from EUR 3 million .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect retail customers to pay extensively for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele which is luxuri@@ ously equipped by the wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; no other banks are currently known to the Association of Co@@ operatives , who charge an over@@ burden on deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative opposite the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and the migration of investors leads to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before heading to the comment section , to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ ite men &apos;s middle ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is no hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings where once independent sellers have been resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and mood by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when they appeared and again sold objects he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about their com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people generally have to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to see that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took offen@@ se on the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar LP covers , from items that keep happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is so much for me as a collector and I think that there are so many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; an employee walks out of a stack of records .
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet been listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I sne@@ ak through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came in just recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player .
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who come in very slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest synthetic and sex@@ ed pop in place of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but psychological trau@@ mas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she is more than a shopping spre@@ e than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; it does not earn much , therefore collecting boards is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to smu@@ ggle the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cro@@ sley disk player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; disk art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; although my research yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums , are not considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that they would have a fire and health risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also indicated that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns raised by the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the jungle Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in a non@@ profit organization and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; over 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migran@@ ts estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ appointing performance at the Olympic time , he did not want to let Tony Martin sit down . &quot;

he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place .
&quot; honestly , it &apos;s hard for me to comment on the past of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he must analyze in peace , which reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic &quot; &quot; Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler &quot; &quot; of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no unnecessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed sensor for the compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted using a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as transit b@@ ans by time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state of the art , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also shi@@ mmer@@ ing outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order from 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain picks up silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
&quot; Fiji delivered a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line flow and ru@@ by force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ e@@ da@@ ille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they defeated New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the strong defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day , could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fiji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost each game in Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and unle@@ ashed the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . on , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ sted in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with only four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a pres@@ ump@@ tuous T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the Berg of Mann @-@ Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute Kob@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went down a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the Revi@@ val and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and ran to the line to make a gate .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while UK still taught . &quot;
this is the way it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went well for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan , whose fans sang , sw@@ ung flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle was ton@@ ed , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked down in the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on that day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a short half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ thine gold than in these games and that will mean what .
&quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 tough h@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if only the two were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed from the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without a tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter unlimited use , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the nature of the triumph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference , and it was none other than the coach , who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if in such circumstances the correct term is at all . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was hospit@@ alized and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ven@@ er@@ ful morning talking more than usual , trying to handle his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go outside and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
this would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary for clarity caused 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia damaged the purpose . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ gruppe &quot; &quot; charges &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was in the Emplo@@ ye@@ e Emplo@@ ye@@ e for 31 years , 28 of them as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply agreements for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water attend@@ ant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new wells ( 1998 ) and indem@@ n@@ ity of farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the new purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the replacement of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no stand@@ still and you have always added new things because water and drinking water are the most important food .
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has spent himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he lived down@@ right the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia Water Forum . &quot;
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal tu@@ g .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being of Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the pipe breaking at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn can also be maintained only once , because you filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Industry Association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man moves to life partner
&quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district stor@@ mar@@ n ) . &quot;
&quot; the man himself ph@@ oned with us and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. might be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Provi@@ ding light for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to checkout . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent fall . &quot;
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel &apos; Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation escal@@ ated further , as the world &apos;s largest producer of gro@@ wers China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has increased . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted not to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
around 8@@ 6.000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Unit announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more vivid , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she is doing something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; due to regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; speaking and organizing to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly call their lungs are not so quickly out of the pu@@ est in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour community of senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; due to lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers suffer from long @-@ term events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a particular performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people who live alone , do not only focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem increases by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I am a long time for something , I will improve and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , advises L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound comes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , one can easily connect . &quot;
many towns also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found over the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males by scre@@ aming the k@@ itt@@ ens
&quot; in Hannover , bi@@ ologists have investigated the effect of litter of cat babies on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies at the che@@ wing of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster on the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who choose to find out in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary College and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
tom@@ cat also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cries out with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a rep@@ ose of little ones , who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very arous@@ ed kit@@ ten played . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ e with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ cker@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cker@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , another important football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ rivals of Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the case of the exception of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it is not possible to stop football even before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ cker@@ r , the Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South African living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ cker@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October ; in fact , however , this has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the police club Bes@@ ky@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; however , what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ky@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master reached a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ky@@ tas the year was better .
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que @-@ King lay the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; following the coup attempt at the State of AC in Florence , the Gom@@ ez @-@ based Gom@@ ez was only announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated volume of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we can &apos;t pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has been closed twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ g@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing lock compla@@ ined their starting right just before the games , was ki@@ cked out and ki@@ cked off at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scenario : with a sm@@ ashed smile she was still standing in the hall , provo@@ king her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a celeb@@ r@@ ity , that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are still many other sports@@ men , who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial characters in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; the Olympic champion of 2004 and the former World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic gr@@ itted the ab@@ sent@@ ing dose and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , inspired Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : hardly an athlete showed so many medals afterwards . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after testosterone dop@@ ing was detected in him .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European Championship title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
&quot; the Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ da@@ ille , also recognized as the 2008 Olympic Games , was given back to CA@@ S due to a judgement of the International Sports Court . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second on the World Ranking List . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record and gold favourite lady has only been tested positive in May but is still allowed to start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 year @-@ old World Championship , references to taking a banned dietary supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA fell slightly and ran off on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I had already left it . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explosive charges went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation in the proximity of the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong which was popular among holiday@@ makers .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the explo@@ sives went into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , there were several injured det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday @-@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is about the deeds of the Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not associated with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept confidential information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country . however , they were not informed of the exact date and places . &quot;
nor is it unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are again and again smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not direct themselves against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the long @-@ term bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on his website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim populations , it is not necessary to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution laid out by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , has prof@@ ited itself to have led the Kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just under a year ago , in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; according to several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen , the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - have already observed the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the decision , Ma@@ assen said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete promotion for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , from several federal states , reports on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been given . &quot;
&quot; he said , for that he had no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party , in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor is , therefore , whether such persons have control influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in right @-@ wing criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ yo said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that it can be right @-@ wing terrorism . &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other ri@@ gh@@ tist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism should not be discern@@ ed . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the cause of concern .
&quot; many of the suspi@@ cious attacks on asylum seekers have not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing in common with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which have then radic@@ alized themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records have not always determined the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance by Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ ly important s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ its was then converted into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a back@@ log of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ians got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more famous in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media referred to him as the &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; prosperity tree , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ free style , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to take over 100 metres of free @-@ style on his own . &quot;
f@@ rene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics , and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot;
a seat in the foremost series for the breathtaking architecture of the central library of Los Angeles
&quot; learn more about the history of the central library in the city centre , as the Society of Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Southern California Chapter holds a salon with Arnold Schwar@@ tz@@ man and Stephen Ge@@ e , the author of the new book &quot; Los Angeles Central Library : a History of its Art and Architecture . &quot; &quot;

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a store in the new place has been best@@ owed .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der had left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back on the next morning at 8.@@ 15@@ am , 250 Euro had disappeared out of the cash desk . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
there is no video surveillance available .
Tru@@ mp does not look so close to the im@@ pending election defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election to the U.S. president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he is going to go on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp is losing U.S. presidential elections in November , though it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , it is al@@ right , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
postal service increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post office plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; in short , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the post office wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to go into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letter and parcel , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ executive Jürgen Ger@@ der said , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely questions , for example by arti@@ sans . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group will shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in its post @-@ factory production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
Ger@@ des announced that the Group intends to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
Gf@@ K leadership succ@@ eeds in dis@@ appointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the with@@ drew suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K ensured that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more in@@ secure the longer the success promised by him .
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the worldwide number Five of the industry faces a human new beginning . &quot;
the Gf@@ K Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the management board of the board of directors will take over the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ print@@ ing@@ . he shared the company . &quot;
&quot; he will officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted to not name a company spokesman on Friday .
anyone who will become the market research company in the future is still unclear .
&quot; on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring introduced over years ago was great . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot;

accidents - bus slides in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) , eight people were injured in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police reported . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave her data according to an accommod@@ ating vice , which partly drove on the reverse . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the crash site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured passengers were brought back from a regular bus to the Pe@@ w@@ sum Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n district .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees for the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ heimer will amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf € 3.@@ 64 ( previous year : 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ sized calculation , the waste water in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach noted that under the authorization of the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach decided that under@@ cover systems were used for these sewage installations . &quot;
&quot; due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ thi@@ essen , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period should also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; the serious fee increases explained that in all three wastewater facilities there are relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; as a result of their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses in all three plants will continue to have a significant impact on all three plants . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ thi@@ essen , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation plant in the az@@ endorf sewage system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water waste in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; were fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; in the past 20 years , Schmidt was spar@@ ed the market community of great entertainment costs in the sewage installations over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in terms of stone houses , especially since it is possible to extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer purpose association in order to not extend these facilities because it is de@@ priv@@ y facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 6.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its fil@@ ter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ uses come to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised themselves in which they were accused of having the app black face promoting or propag@@ ating white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested some U@@ sers a filter that gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics call it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail , whose tweet about the photos were widespread that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; damaged &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ protected , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the equivalent extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ shots of a large audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and a telephone interview , she said she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the Snap@@ chat settings . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the largely white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ stituted population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , in turn , said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence services , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command set up service intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as they had allowed the real conditions on site , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Ar@@ med Forces Committee , intelligence officers and military budget committees , reports great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , which was typically picked up by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly referred to a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that governmental heads have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com citizen publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command staff changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were promised that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com Reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the Adam B. Shi@@ p House of Represent@@ atives , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaging the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats did not give any hint of intervention of the White House at Cent@@ com analysts in regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published Tuesday through &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon General inspec@@ tor , who received analy@@ st complaints after complaints from Cent@@ com . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokesman of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor is still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim , which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of quar@@ rels of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , written a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush had only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements of the government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were in operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; she knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will take the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed one will take a little longer for the strong Dutch woman to lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising whi@@ r@@ l through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn to better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull out the helm completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door @-@ ri@@ bs in the first half of the game with a flash@@ back from the near area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ escap@@ ably , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff , which is handed from the w@@ rist@@ band @-@ protection to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ af@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been under these familiar names which are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event alike .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may have dominion long .
&quot; but if I would like to make arguments for my specific dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years were so spar@@ se that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
that could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes for competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and have had an athlete until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain outside char@@ me , partly because it fits the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving that combines two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as a spring@@ board . &quot;
&quot; rising conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to shoot a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on your feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic program , they are rated according to performance , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , upward and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also in the television broadcast another height goal : those of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she su@@ cks off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
&quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds , as part of a afternoon block , on both days from 14@@ .00 . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ us and the obj@@ ectivity of male athletes , as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia fell on violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more territories .
&quot; last week , thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests which are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security guards beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights authority is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; according to Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terror across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to show oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethi@@ op@@ ian . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from floor use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far more critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of facing down under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and improved internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians claimed they were assembled to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is margin@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , who account for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in receiving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction , and using special mand@@ ates to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless . &quot;
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region Nord@@ Ethi@@ op@@ ia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of protests prot@@ ested , apparently fu@@ cked by the government by analysts and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il was passing relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ eth@@ ic town , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp has declared Obama &apos;s asser@@ tion that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , attacking his repeatedly repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
&quot; it also brings forth his comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful period , in the peculiar position , to explain statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was back in terms of the asser@@ tion on Thursday , insi@@ sting that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite of the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp had said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism ble@@ w down on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the basis of falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp once again tried to return to this subject .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more estim@@ ating tone since his survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Turkey , gave himself great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp claims about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ tails , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by forcing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp hen@@ ce@@ forth continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being ro@@ uted to each of his words and to be prejudi@@ ced against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the poor , miserable &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp as only proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once sold over the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; b Cafe was a big@@ oted cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie business , replacing Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people smoked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural keys .
&quot; the café doesn &apos;t serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old clients were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a little coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez stated that he did not have a gru@@ dge that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for spo@@ iling with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to leave them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ shop wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies at Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a dessert pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , fri@@ pper@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ acking , this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cream cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it has to be in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; women were cooked by women for male fields and freshly baked cakes for breakfast , lunch and dinner were served . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the roads with which the country turned around to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies were added to stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food residue &quot; as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying fruits .
&quot; meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , as a high @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy common sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
&quot; like never before or ever , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 - 1943 - have enjoyed the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ p@@ tions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic goo@@ dies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude . &quot;
&quot; while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully un@@ realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt could have committed the same mistake if Ele@@ an@@ or his wife had asked him to stamp out an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science has been applied to foods . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
brick one recalls : &quot; they actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind@@ mill incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said and added that it was a common plo@@ y to modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ ved a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game , to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil conserv@@ ation@@ ist , showing him in a 11 hour b@@ ail out of the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , he said , according to the image , &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie mostly come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats over a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie only get offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; in a lei@@ surely way , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 metres far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a maximum of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long suspected that Greenland will become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie lifestyle .
&quot; their slow motion , as they lived in front of S@@ val@@ bard , allowed six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ e@@ water and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ arks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
&quot; their birth , therefore , was to lie in the early 1960s , when atomic weapons attempt to drag huge amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the l@@ enti@@ l nucleus , on the other hand , contained a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res could even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to classi@@ fy an age .
&quot; because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland hair with the multip@@ lication obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ Dar@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame @-@ flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become especially big . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal buff@@ ers heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; thus a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more into a long life . &quot;
building site in a double pack
&quot; at the latest meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues related to building . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated living areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after clari@@ fying the real estate , par@@ c@@ itation and settlement issues and the applications for sur@@ veying were clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the municipality is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community beau@@ ties appeal to young families and rebel@@ li@@ ous sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , about the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to make inquiries for the establishment of further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the industrial area already designated there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n . &quot;
Frankfurt profits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; accordingly , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether cash homes will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK has so far been given to them . &quot;
that is why big US banks are using this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk treas@@ ury ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg still conce@@ als a large fund industry , but it cuts the infrastructure worse in the same way as Dublin . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is significantly easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city boasts easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate . &quot;

Gilead acqu@@ ires legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US arbitr@@ ator decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs , arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster medication so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jur@@ ist and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US official judge , Beth@@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used each other to acc@@ use and ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokesman on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ CS ) are cur@@ tail@@ ing the city , following the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ CS . &quot;

Clinton earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in speech hon@@ or@@ ars ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia announced his tax returns for the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and back@@ sliding in terms of his promises to date . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hero@@ in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tru@@ mp Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business plans and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp calls on his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million and pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tru@@ mp has held a meeting to exchange their tax returns . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average annual tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 Clinton &apos;s tax return showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike the majority of Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der and fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has intensified its support together with the US nature protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the Universal Gaz@@ ette Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , with much more confidence that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps cover the illumination of the elephant with a torch and blow into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chi@@ ff@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with the earth , together with a fire@@ works body , it is packed into a con@@ dom which ends up to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last option is a thro@@ wer that shoots a golden fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director breaks the Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election has been removed by &quot; Arab &quot; appeal - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media clock after announ@@ cing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election as it claimed Arab guests according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the New Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
did Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; ch@@ oked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliberate decision of management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big response from the Internet in which people called the whole scandal .
&quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it had given the alleged appeals of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed &quot; , &quot; it was said in another article , where it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order to &quot; &quot; record Israel &quot; &quot; into the quick election list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disp@@ el the students , which meant that the police put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest of Russian enterprises in the country grew strongly in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies rely on existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation was about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travelling vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for : beverage market falling in forest oil
a rob@@ bery case has been carried out on Thursday evening on the Be@@ we XXL beverage market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , took cash from the cler@@ k &apos;s staff and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is very visible .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel car park in the parking area with the silver colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations about the crime time ( against 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , which are related to the rob@@ bery @-@ raid , is urgently to report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : playing and enjoying summer free time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical daily group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer free time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week in the calm@@ ly located Lei@@ sure theim Hotel .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ asse with the visit of the stro@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days , the group was delighted by the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers were treated with their self @-@ prepared meals like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were cur@@ led , beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and youths returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch at St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers , the top minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ te St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage aims have been tested and one decided finally for the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy at Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgri@@ m objective was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern , were in the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and distributed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where a cathedral of Our Lady is also standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made ra@@ ws at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from a specially formed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and stren@@ uous dinner , and breakfast at the stage targets . &quot;
we continued on the second day about Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after it came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , at first we had to pull off some 500 metres of altitude and then climbed up again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue in the evening .
&quot; after the dawn of the fourth pilgri@@ m day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg &apos;s final stage . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at Frei@@ burger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is approached by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar . &quot;
the next day it was time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold earned for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ o@@ mine in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself E@@ igen . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after they held only a modest sixth place in London , despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots now un@@ folding .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner put an Olympic champion in the qualification round , but in the stand@@ off rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was just short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which execution drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der as they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
we have set up an Olympic battle in the final round and the World Champion defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there were indications that after a weak start he was visi@@ bly dropped on the train . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s rivals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect to expect five days in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the area of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same thing from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22,@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will certainly focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and terminated tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a medal of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid sex and painting repro@@ aches as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ t@@ down of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , since the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to give any further subsidies to the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the sm@@ el@@ ting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p keep smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should come into force as of November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the electric supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription tot@@ alling $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; capacity of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to guarantee the power supply to the enam@@ el . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts each year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants were to disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator this wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and running at fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , a critical reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n and in the presence of the well @-@ known show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é act of almost every episode episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a TV station at 8 am ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself . &quot;
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is more similar to an image book than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were adver@@ tised on 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
the disclosure of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still transp@@ i@@ red before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 . one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls below the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se with her reality TV @-@ story .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
&quot; these feelings were co@@ cky again , when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover . &quot;
but lying around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her own pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; community centers have 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid posts are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry insi@@ sts on the impact of further short@@ cuts to over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and similar - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already busy , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l community centre , said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for right @-@ wing assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of re@@ port@@ edly drawing weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp Campa@@ ign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on a staff , while in February they were on the road in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i preten@@ ded to have been waiting for months for the matter to be controlled internally , before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and cur@@ sed the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i noted that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed an u@@ pro@@ ar when he told a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapon friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was to appoint . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp Campa@@ ign made it clear that the media had pulled out its words from the context and that it would not con@@ sp@@ ire into violence .
&quot; ordin@@ is Com@@ pla@@ int demands compensation from the campaign for viol@@ ating the duty of care , and of Philip because of bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot;
&quot; for a statement , Tru@@ mp Pres@@ ses@@ c@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks could not be reached . &quot;
attempts to contact Philip did not fail .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U character@@ ize . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite light losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are hes@@ it@@ ant back into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Ab@@ ge@@ ord@@ net@@ enhaus with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominated the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes at the beginning , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to the shops exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover , Germany , as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e @-@ mails for that time , even by fax it was possible to reach the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , ie 1,@@ 400 Euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone industry experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today the market is dominated by vendors who came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , and Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first in early 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the chance to see . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German today sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Board of Human Resources . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now valid as a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just like in 2012 in London , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already employ 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ throw is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ellers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion , and a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , who has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and to expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the time @-@ cur@@ ving Open Source Community and the conver@@ sions has been underway since the invention of indicating lock@@ ers , &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media enterprise has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying scor@@ ners have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use scor@@ ebo@@ ards worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has set it on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokesman . &quot;
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a lot of revenue so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Center &quot; &quot; to control people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
driving woman in suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call on witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning had passed by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these and any witnesses of the incident prompt him to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligent killing after passing a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had answered an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Cli@@ mam@@ mo@@ ell : Venus once was inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless continued slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the day &apos;s side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously assumed by planet scientists . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years . &quot;
her oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen left , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the Aval@@ an@@ che Trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as coach and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , which requires it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the post@@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference for five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Norwegian ee@@ pers resume talks , put strikes &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles with regard to the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties are betting on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to address the issues .
&quot; trade unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people for its part and plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest work disputes held in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest way .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ations , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars are turning slower than less solid stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars running slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star res@@ ig@@ ns
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players present similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old shouldn &apos;t be accepted into the Hall of Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , banned stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis scandal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for many years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , then South Asian . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days do not run no@@ is@@ elessly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; adds Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson was told , sympathy @-@ hu@@ gs of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lifting Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are being over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
an expert athlete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have been known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the critical athle@@ tics competitions . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m of open style . &quot;
chen has applied for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Criminal Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is not the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of the athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio the news of the positive rehear@@ sal went out at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; he was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athlete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance about the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported to the athlete with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the overall sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation of IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , the runner @-@ up in Kenya has also produced many bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier transgres@@ sions in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of freedom , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims readily paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators especially speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ ma@@ iled falls considerably higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the paint programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; at first , private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ aches took place quickly in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of the Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currencies . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ acker in turn know this and try to build up a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure used the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they declare their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must pay partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky winn@@ ings from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their malicious software in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by buying the malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price of between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the boards in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment will be made per infected host .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known among many companies that better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be prevented using file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful capture , the offen@@ ders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations instead , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetrators could also completely adopt new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ konferenz &quot; &quot; Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get their control connected to the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda will pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls down there . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with high raised and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests available , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ cop@@ es and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to ceilings . &quot;
&quot; the boot can be loaded well , but the height of the load is 650 mm higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; however , the steering should be a little more direct . &quot;
&quot; in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( working until tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane neck assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the road sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ jack lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline not responsible : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable with danger , which are typical of aviation . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had frac@@ tured a knee injury during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened all over - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of disease : when the organis@@ er pays
&quot; after their journey , travelers will only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without a doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than 10 percent of the guests have demonstrated the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their stay . &quot;
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
their illness led the holiday@@ makers back to a defective treatment plant which supposedly polluted the sea water .
the family thought that the journey had been insufficient - and compla@@ ined to the organizers .
&quot; before the court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
&quot; however , the organis@@ er only learned about this before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs . &quot;
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not violate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
there were only 38 guests of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
promoting terrorism should be punished again .
&quot; video surveillance must be improved , arm@@ or law should be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult . &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated duty of confidentiality for physicians should be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions how to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for the treatment of traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly expressed itself against action . &quot;
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a general prohibition of full @-@ veil conce@@ als it un@@ constitutional .
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid anything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to the court .
&quot; the Green Party , Simone Peter , proposed that he wants to simul@@ ate action force and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror @-@ par@@ c@@ els . &quot;
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are in traffic on the environmental road every evening in traffic jams when driving over the highway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( August 16 / 17 ) , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art road construction will extend the right bend in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße by 700 meters . &quot;
mot@@ orists can then turn right from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early on , thus improving the overall production sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ t@@ ago road and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
reason is the eye @-@ catcher on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided by a single lane over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb heavy load traffic in two lanes . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory @-@ daily traffic jam will continue , the competent provincial operation cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to come , the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state enterprise deliberately chose the bu@@ si@@ est time during the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities . &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Tourism : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; The invisible home . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Forest School Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the production in the little house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most youngsters of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ys , and the young theatre will work together in the next season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tourism &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; they have their names because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is already far before the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , member of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you see for the moment , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in- and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; especially the sleeping feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Haus@@ er Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is not seldom an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is particularly common in the case of depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts wondering about everyday problems and worries , there is also an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with a doctor ?
&quot; for those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised during the day , should go to the doctor , advises . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look very different : you are beaten , tired , ind@@ eli@@ ble , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; physician In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medical Center Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises you on shooting . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to the slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the slaughter laboratory , doctors advise for example in snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of dise@@ ased day@@ time fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is not necessary to prepare for the examination . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ba@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after dressing , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ ends at the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of adjusting screws , in which one can set for a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and standing hours , not too long in bed , sleep on the day , not watch TV for sleep , avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not really condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to offer with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had won gold for the first time in Doh@@ a &apos;s short @-@ circuit world champi@@ onships and at the same time exhibited his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , on the other hand , the dop@@ ing checks are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much and do not look so closely on the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly the case with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Al@@ lies arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in taking two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
&quot; as a gang , the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage theft . &quot;
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft crimes . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July , and were involved in a collaborative , casual and particularly professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four actions for the thi@@ eves , who had specifically travelled to Germany for the commission of criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this at first sight , but the police numbers them to the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when you walk along the road from east to west , you come to play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built by 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , articles about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , prefers to be dominated by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the tenants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Interior Minister , especially Berlin , spoke several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were evacu@@ ated , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three men on the ground , closed parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain vor@@ m late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighborhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants to promote police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , the Berlin interior minister and the police between house @-@ owners and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the rest of the city , Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a lower average and high poverty rate . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated in a regular street battle in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly magn@@ ets for tourists and poll@@ uting companies from around the world : residents of GDR times and former home occup@@ ants share their neighborhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the rental rates , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them at disc@@ arded slices or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags . &quot;
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; Left @-@ autonomous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are based , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most part of the criminal off@@ ences make material damage , which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is wei@@ ghty : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to Riga .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be removed : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so good in bed , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can one do if someone never stops listening ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer didn &apos;t understand a bit of understanding : the house projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who prefers , should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented with first names asked not to be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new commission@@ er for refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Kunde from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the uns@@ ett@@ led lust of lust , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous wo@@ ollen dairy . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on the spot and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers are soon to be found in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
&quot; the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work , you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be dish@@ ear@@ tened , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; thus , new containers will soon be placed in the washing line . &quot;
&quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot;
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , single @-@ euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ cu@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need special offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; thus , administration and honorary officials also jump here . &quot;
it is important that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; those who eventually feel the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not be able to work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others , too . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small congregation such as Ur@@ bach , after the most recent incidents ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and should not be excluded . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would bring them up completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary officials must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would un@@ wind the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Cul@@ tures are already busy to integrate the existing people properly .
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ary looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several different areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ den in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ls . &quot;
they fled toward the city center .
&quot; for the prosecution , the police set up several police squ@@ ads as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag was without success .
perhaps the unknow@@ ns were in fact close to the apartment or when they were fle@@ eing .
