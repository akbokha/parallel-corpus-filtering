<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at that pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career eventually ended."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Saturday was Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournaments, again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself lead with his family about the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the first time in Aachen, and therefore also with CHIO, was a long time."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed the man from Anhausen within the frame of a small gala the Golden sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"silver bay leaf, champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adjourned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means very much to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"on the other hand, however, the two US presidential applicants are on tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "Trump" "wants to remain small in doubt and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be completely different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will go back to massive regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore taxes on the rich would increase," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost eloquently."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be no party internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil extraction is also to be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to cancel it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme and demands:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, both of the US do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid even better, says Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics regard him so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Talking to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a carrier of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentral accommodations for all-frozen women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope-makers to Europe," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there are other reasons for escaping:" many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they come to Germany, mislead, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in roughly 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the Munich North, traumatized, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't know to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, asks Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, only winged women are not lodged separately," says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be lodged separately from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" "it is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is lacking or are taken together by men and women, it can become more and more permanent - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel this need of protection, one can read at the rush that the house is in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily set up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called for their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would" "persistently quiet" "to problems, leading to the fact that the contract was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official renegotiation for all your concerns."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated ballroom of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was slippily, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "dear friend" "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if it had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was incinerated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen Russia back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the crime was even greater, as it was perpetrated by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the nesting is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, which would be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after having been dismissed by a failed coup d" état in the past month. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Veosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious on the West, since its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is considered a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge over the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded assistance for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that feel bad and badly treated by the West and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have stripped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey knocked out the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "said the CEO."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian), that later he was the Director of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Regiment staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your trust. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "I think it's the main task of the government to support your work as head of state on bills and controls to implement your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Seryozha Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin, working as he worked for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile on the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president to lead the Russian environmental policy once met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - job for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia since a third term Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deck blower", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slashes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historic and symbolic moment when the Queensferry crossings are built."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete casting for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is the future-oriented high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North-tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the north feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive as the Viadukt is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team were working, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds for Braunschweiggers cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: future investors should be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next council session, the SPD will propose a" "concept of action". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann believes:" "we agree with the Greens: if anyone wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be identified as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also be built on the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, as Bratmann says:" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such farms, but as 20 per cent of the dwellings as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so viola:" there is currently no agreement between the political groups. ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"no matter what, as viola, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not entirely complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one reconcile the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be bought out bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be reconsidered to bring apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western city, deadlines are running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be picked up there back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social dwellings in the western city is drastically increased, one removes from the objective of the so-called agitation."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens count on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people away from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games, and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest declined before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," photographed "(over a screenshot on the cell phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation playing the game, when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35.000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who will play Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take" "take 30 minutes" "to" "get out of the sofa" "and" "be active every day" "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly plays sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also grumpy game corrupters who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit enabled us to pursue our activity earlier, they did not give us any reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemon success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people to hunt, more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and heard music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I propose to myself under the women's olympiamity in the Turning and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is the Catholics, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic medalist and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gyula routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but it does not look like gymnastics in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the nearest Olympic team will have only four turrets in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turns are an expensive sport and that Turner is primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we must augment the churches aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and accessible gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my cycle of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (above all black and Hispanic) and train national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of" Girl Power "by the Holes of the Olympic team gold and thank you, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 resident practitioners who voted for a vote declined."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt had plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS had found itself in a" "Niemandsland" "and would be damaging to any further delay for the employees and patients."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first investigators will receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend contributions in order to improve the maintenance at times of time."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Assistants announced last night in a communication with:" "assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current crisis crisis and will administer it to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we talked to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health, as well as other ministries, responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training courses, training lessons, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness allows election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"last year, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman removed a government report about corruption out of office."</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally interferes with police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of abuse due to" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, which is now an antactionist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of electoral circus to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have a reference to themselves, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must simply name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply not removable ink to a person's finger when they release their voting votes to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against election fraud, but also serves to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special dish decided that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" his campaign based on the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him. "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses one another.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent letter election - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding expressions to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as proof that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the Elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" sensitivities in ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists work postnatal documents to stop" "pick-up". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, considered by Theresa May, also demands tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists deal with full letter selections and envelopes of letter selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up lockouts for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation facilitated by intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photographing in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees usually assert that voters go to the ballot alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric drops over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" amazing, "that after the Tower Hamlets no criminal complaint was placed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral Court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "check checks" "of the election registers of the Town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the judgment in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the buyers did not know where to go, when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in order to make the situation worse, she looked up as she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf again."</seg>
<seg id="4">They continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Primark Shop in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put it back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried underwear, she went back and left the business without buying anything."</seg>

<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer to your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when approaching you from behind, then you should turn around as a first so that you can see your attacker and go out of the shot line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"hit him with his knee in the bar and twist while the aggressor jumps from pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist them so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, place the weight on the weapon and hit the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and fix the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabbles his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and sausage lex a serious test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk pushed his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the removal of each object he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to be embarked on.</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of picking up the flush-button of a pulling toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he clicked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railroads to railway stations to washing bays of toilets, the task was definitely put under a sample."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he told me:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to fulfil his reputation in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands amounts less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to leak after its luminescence was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes close to the worst I've put in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying 'Let's call us Ian.</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to dock it and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they should at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls showed lamenting holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was a nightmare for people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family added, street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strife and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>

<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogized them and their partners forcibly from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delegates were cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't rebuke anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>

<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally away, it will be beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the outstretched side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenants have agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, since a delogiation is always the last step to consider Cornwall housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and gave us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="4">"after an attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary informed that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the IAAF World Association has requested the IOC to investigate the case in order to enforce its own investigations, a IAAF spokesman announced."</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the examination and the following measures taken by the IOC, the IAAF will assess an assessment," stated it in an IAAF statement. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family has been told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-nearby Stiftung Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurd municipality of Germany reckons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it might even be" several hundred thousand, "the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the hard forwardness of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurd municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the president of the" "World" "Association of Agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with straits several months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the vain putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that assimilates refugees, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of the Association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alawite cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">That is why Erdogan hopes to raise the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks were eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also CDU member."</seg>
<seg id="14">He insisted that the federal government was "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, a" witch hunt "takes place against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for the first time in the past months, I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition parties."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen-trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and seculars," "said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the" World. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on numbers from the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum-holders in Germany against the coup in front of the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Sunday election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament decided already at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it's not stupid than until now: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the campaign, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most vacationers who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a local, so should not choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: in the holidays are helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and counting on the end, only troublesome."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of cooking."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost invisible election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, spread roses and chatted a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seeley got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame at the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" We create das "have speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which presumably will cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when at the wrong time you make an election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's federal election circuit is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently at the NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's no pity anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Northeast CDU does not deprive of the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays only a" minor role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that in the country, you have to push the base away that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the pages of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election campaign coke to his comrades, however, is self-exposing:" they must go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called up his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats finally lay behind partners CDU (25) and just below the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the land tag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely move their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign", "calls it the chairman Claudia Müller."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about on the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30am and only end at about 20 o'clock in the morning, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the weekend, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is also commended to meet those responsible for the construction of those responsible, for example when it comes to setting up accommodation trips."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has moved southwards on Monday and the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdynia has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now go on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passing traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the deputy head office manager Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many villagers were looking for themselves and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">"what led to the fact, that some trucks in residential areas were getting frantic."</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overtures," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest one was at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 renovation has led to sales arrivals in them, everyone is asked to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer" "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "maximum slight drop", "but also acknowledges that" "the run-out" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily captured are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have" hit hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the clients were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">It points to "far more than 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"street painting has been" "thrown back" "for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt stated on a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now, it also has to carry the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"for all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been located here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if one cannot approach, it is also very nice elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the fact that his pedigree is back again after the renovation works, Göhner has no doubt."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, he was on the side of the results and reached a" "achievable consensus" "within the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière did a little bit of time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some are already known, announced, announced, that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapon rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will launch a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and knock the jihadists into the German passport with double nationality."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," "clears the CDU man."</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still holds this to be reasonable and does not demand anything, which has no chance at the coalitionpartner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he is planning a quick method for deportations and more opportunities to incarnate people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should check their smartphones before and reveal social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of Dulles for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to pose some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still work unwittingly and leaves unanswered questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the case of unequal treatment of patient, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of high refugee figures."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people deeply concerned, did not allow themselves to be cluttered even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved into the focus enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral competitions."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, the European Union and the SPD are increasingly placing themselves in position on the issue of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, between the two parties it went high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a fight against the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy-collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a return from the double nationality."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also struggles here for irreconcilable sounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before heading to the comment section, to see him under the pseudonym Non-Allemonite men's middle ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is no hordes by hobbysers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than:" "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings where once independent sellers have been resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and mood by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when they appeared and again sold objects he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about their comeback and are forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people generally have to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took offense on the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar LP covers, from items that keep happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is so much for me as a collector and I think that there are so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" an employee walks out of a stack of records.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet been listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I sneak through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came in just recently and said," "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who come in very slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthetic and sexed pop in place of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but psychological traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more than a shopping spree than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not earn much, therefore collecting boards is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to smuggle the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley disk player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"although my research yielded that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, are not considered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday tomorrow with security not with strolling through sheet stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through sheets, while they avoid the starving look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who elevates nothing to middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that they would have a fire and health risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also indicated that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns raised by the prefecture of Calais are absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in a nonprofit organization and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"over 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure" "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji delivered a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line flow and ruby force to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost by the not too bad consolation prize - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the strong defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, they lost each game in Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and unleashed the attacks of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau frosted in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with only four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a presumptuous Tackle of Mitchell stopped the Berg of Mann-Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Kobasa Veremalua went down a touch-down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the Revival and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak Tacklings of the UK team and ran to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while UK still taught."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went well for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultan, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle was toned, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked down in the grass."</seg>
<seg id="28">"earlier on that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a short half-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the British 15-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinthine gold than in these games and that will mean what.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first strokes to the last, 220 tough hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if only the two were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed from the second Olympiagold in the two without a tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, who put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39.ter unlimited use, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the nature of the triumphal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental advances that make the difference, and it was none other than the coach, who didn't know 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if in such circumstances the correct term is at all."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was hospitalized and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a venerful morning talking more than usual, trying to handle his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week. it might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he's the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go outside and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>

<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Providing light for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants for the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry," said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue). "</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to checkout."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent fall."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel' Future ', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emissions legislation," "stated IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation escalated further, as the world's largest producer of growers China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has increased."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at the end, ThyssenKrupp also wanted not to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86.000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Unit announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more vivid, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"due to regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "speaking and organizing to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly call their lungs are not so quickly out of the puest in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour community of senior citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening of songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"due to lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers suffer from long-term events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a particular performance is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people who live alone, do not only focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem increases by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I am a long time for something, I will improve and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"there are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound comes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, Seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can easily connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but probably it is about the deeds of the Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the attacks, Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not associated with the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records have not always determined the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the brave performance by Robel Kiros Habit at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overly important swimmers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures."</seg>

<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habits was then converted into a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a backlog of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more famous in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as the "rouble of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" prosperity tree, "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-metre-free style, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to take over 100 metres of free-style on his own."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics, and had never completed such a long distance before the competition."</seg>

<seg id="6">"from October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welthiessen, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to reach deeper into the purse."</seg>

<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation plant in the azendorf sewage system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be evacuated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtertool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All misuses come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have criticised themselves in which they were accused of having the app black face promoting or propagating white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested some Users a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics call it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of injurious clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote in an e-mail, whose tweet about the photos were widespread that the filter was" "hurting" "and" "damaged". ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-protected, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the equivalent extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapshots of a large audience of young people - who are more diverse in the race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters a picture that is offensive to a user," "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier," "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and a telephone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the Snapchat settings."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command set up service intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as they had allowed the real conditions on site, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Armed Forces Committee, intelligence officers and military budget committees, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their estimates of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, which was typically picked up by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly referred to a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that governmental heads have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom citizen publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command staff changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were promised that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings, while the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom Reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Ship House of Representatives, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damaging the morals among analysts and" gave excessive space for divergent opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats did not give any hint of intervention of the White House at Centcom analysts in regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published Tuesday through" "The Daily Beast". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon General inspector, who received analyst complaints after complaints from Centcom."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector is still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim, which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of quarrels of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, written a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush had only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team around Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements of the government airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were in operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain stands before"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams will take the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed one will take a little longer for the strong Dutch woman to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the Kader."</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull out the helm completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the door-ribs in the first half of the game with a flashback from the near area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapably, a fast relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, which is handed from the wristband-protection to the swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leafy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been under these familiar names which are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have dominion long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I would like to make arguments for my specific darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although trampolines have been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years were so sparse that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes for competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on trampolines and have had an athlete until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has a certain outside charme, partly because it fits the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earth bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving that combines two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as a springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to shoot a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on your feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic program, they are rated according to performance, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, upward and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also in the television broadcast another height goal: those of the world or the Olympiarekord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she sucks off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">"NBC will radiate the final rounds, as part of a afternoon block, on both days from 14.00."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Angus and the objectivity of male athletes, as the male US-Turner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia fell on violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests which are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security guards beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"according to Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to show oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from floor use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far more critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and be able to arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of facing down under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and improved internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies to hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed they were assembled to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is marginally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who account for about 6 per cent of the population and dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized illness for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly well versed in receiving early signs of dissatisfaction, and using special mandates to manipulate opponents and make them harmless."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region NordEthiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of protests protested, apparently fucked by the government by analysts and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil was passing relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amethic town, attacked by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump has declared Obama's assertion that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, attacking his repeatedly repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican Presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings forth his comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful period, in the peculiar position, to explain statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was back in terms of the assertion on Thursday, insisting that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite of the previous day, where Mr. Trump had said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing of it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism blew down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the basis of falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump once again tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained," Of course, I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "according to what the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more estimating tone since his survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a great advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Turkey, gave himself great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump claims about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-tails, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by forcing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump henceforth continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being routed to each of his words and to be prejudiced against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the poor, miserable" TV experts who try to understand him and said, "They can't!" "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump as only proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things."</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café doesn't serve beer anymore, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>

<seg id="34">"today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese."</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez stated that he did not have a grudge that the soap business took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for spoiling with the cold-brewed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go into their offer," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">"and the traditional, Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his accession to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies at Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while bricks were told in their book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, frippery snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable dishes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacking, this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," Brickman said. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cream cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"women were cooked by women for male fields and freshly baked cakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner were served."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the roads with which the country turned around to be no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseries were added to staple foods, the casserole as a" wonderful way to reuse food residue "as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying fruits.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the focal point of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nourishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy common sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at lunch," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats over a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a leisurely way, the Greenland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 metres far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a maximum of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a patronage for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, at least from a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" madness "," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland will become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the Grönlandhaie lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow motion, as they lived in front of Svalbard, allowed six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the icewater and seek cadaver, which torpedo from higher water layers."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-arks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth, therefore, was to lie in the early 1960s, when atomic weapons attempt to drag huge amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular nucleus, which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493-centimeter long Grönlandshark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres could even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to classify an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"because one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland hair with the multiplication obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old GrönlandDaral, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame-flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become especially big."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal buffers heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch at St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scotsman Callum Skinner stormed home when Brite Gold earned for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint at the Velomine in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they held only a modest sixth place in London, despite the resignation of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Andrier Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner put an Olympic champion in the qualification round, but in the standoff rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder was just short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which execution drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder as they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an Olympic battle in the final round and the World Champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, there were indications that after a weak start he was visibly dropped on the train."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect to expect five days in the cycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is possible in the area of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same thing from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I only enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22,42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and terminated tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a medal of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sex and painting reproaches as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, when you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the meltdown of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, since the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to give any further subsidies to the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects as the smelting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland looses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" hedging transactions, "which should come into force as of November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the fiscal year 17," said the electric supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL income from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription totalling $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" capacity of Alcoas... to operate the enamel or to guarantee the power supply to the enamel. ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume around 600 megawatts each year and some 900 megawatts each year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator this wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians), a critical reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the well-known show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest): they all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this is the cliché act of almost every episode episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a TV station at 8 am), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is more similar to an image book than a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertised on 832 pages of the tome 615 pages)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still transpired before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there have been clearly more" celebrities who are modeled "as" models, celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013. one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls below the earlier category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had been one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat tense with her reality TV-story.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">"these feelings were cocky again, when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover."</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the misfortune seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in slow motion: Nokia Communicator entered the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominated the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 Communicator came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, lovers can buy the equipment on the internet, but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover, Germany, as an" office in the west pocket format. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e-mails for that time, even by fax it was possible to reach the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit tormenting slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, ie 1,400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything has been different."</seg>
<seg id="22">"smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns" mobile phone industry experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by vendors who came all a lot later than Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already employ 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fellers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion, and a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, who has implemented a £11 billion investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" "this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the time-curving Open Source Community and the conversions has been underway since the invention of indicating lockers," "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media enterprise has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying scorners have become the industry.</seg>

<seg id="5">"a woman lay down in the dark" in an act of despair "on the road and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was transferred from several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said these and any witnesses of the incident prompt him to report."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless continued slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the day's side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously assumed by planet scientists."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was blown away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen left, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the stars of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates, as well as in which connection the rotational periods with the planet creation rise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest way.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotations, these poignant stars repel large amounts of star winches."</seg>

<seg id="10">"when a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more solid stars are turning slower than less solid stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars running slower Pirouettes than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware Defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators especially specialize their blackmail software on attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be blackmailed falls considerably higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the paint programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at first, private users were the target, but the change to company attaches took place quickly in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and clears the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of the Bitcoin cryptocurrencies."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims:" don't pay, you only support the problem, "says Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure used the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they declare their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must pay partly hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky winnings from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="41">"this means that the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also completely adopt new targets on the internet of things."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Honda will pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top falls down there."</seg>

<seg id="8">"it is not only a trunk of 453 l with high raised and 1026 l backrests available, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>

<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City emergency brake assist (working until tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane neck assistant."</seg>

<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the road sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning is already far before the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weaving, member of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you see for the moment, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an in- and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"especially the sleeping feels many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Hauser Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disturbance is not seldom an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is particularly common in the case of depression," "says Weaving."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts wondering about everyday problems and worries, there is also an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"for those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is compromised during the day, should go to the doctor, advises."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look very different: you are beaten, tired, indelible, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"physician Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre at the Charité University Medical Center Berlin, is hardly available in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, advises you on shooting."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to the slaughterhouse, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the slaughter laboratory, doctors advise for example in snoring with breathing exercises, in case of diseased daytime fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in fact, it is not necessary to prepare for the examination."</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," "says Fibaetze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after dressing, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-ends at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are quite a lot of adjusting screws, in which one can set for a better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleeping and standing hours, not too long in bed, sleep on the day, not watch TV for sleep, avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that is completely and not really conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, articles about this" trendy neighbourhood, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, prefers to be dominated by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the tenants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Interior Minister, especially Berlin, spoke several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go zone "for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous force."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three men on the ground, closed parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the building workers were renovating the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain vorm late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly irritated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wants to promote police protection against vandaliatory leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, the Berlin interior minister and the police between house-owners and their neighbours, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in contrast to the rest of the city, Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a lower average and high poverty rate."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated in a regular street battle in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnets for tourists and polluting companies from around the world: residents of GDR times and former home occupants share their neighborhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rental rates, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them at discarded slices or freshly painted façades, which were thrown with color-bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "Left-autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are based, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most part of the criminal offences make material damage, which tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be removed: through faceless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so good in bed," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can one do if someone never stops listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer didn't understand a bit of understanding: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine Kunde from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the unsettled lust of lust, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less ridiculing than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a jealous woollen dairy."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on the spot and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon to be found in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Councillor to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work, you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be disheartened, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, new containers will soon be placed in the washing line."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but only with apartments, it is not done."</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, single-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no occupational therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deucule and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need special offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"thus, administration and honorary officials also jump here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is important that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"those who eventually feel the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, do not be able to work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others, too."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two have fear of radicalisation, even in a small congregation such as Urbach, after the most recent incidents?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive." a residual risk could and should not be excluded. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would bring them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary officials must look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would unwind the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Cultures are already busy to integrate the existing people properly.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
