Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
both wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and proposes Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal about the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting with reference to the election forthcoming in Israel was rejected . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry that I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that lamb , who had been in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already set 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ camp@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the State , as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence , or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some incl@@ ination to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the doc@@ torate that had worked so hard for the Lamb for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant professor .
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the University , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years trying to teach her the guitar . &quot;
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; all the girls mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played the one or other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community on a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service . &quot;
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lesson will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributing to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products retailer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would plan to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were employed . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to employ time @-@ workers to equip shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated pal@@ mate and a length of footage from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest newspaper film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief once again ur@@ ges all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in response to the crisis in Syria , Ban has called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as the flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the Real Estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp probably won the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one has won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mps staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the popularity of the shri@@ mps has turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mps Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the nation &apos;s first electoral state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their guide @-@ keepers , Republi@@ can voters maintain Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten will say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July , put their money on Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters consider the Tru@@ mp campaign to be plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp leadership , while anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he scored 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a brief majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters support Tru@@ mp , say they have agreed to vote for their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp has been calling an im@@ migrant from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; two months ago , Donald Tru@@ mp was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration on the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with experience of government . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a re@@ building house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter is the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro per square meter , mind you . &quot;
&quot; but good , who can afford it ... &quot;
&quot; by the way : here , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
twice a cake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have embark@@ ed on a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Milan Mission &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth tournament success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; during his 28 hit in the Champions League , Müller received gra@@ cious assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm , before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based ones stopped . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them notable clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their aggressive efforts they often went to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced by playing shift to the left side of Douglas Costa , which rarely went through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper end of the gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct taking , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ stal@@ ks . &quot;
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye about the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ leg@@ ged friend with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup @-@ hero first gave the green light after the shut @-@ off training , said sports officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky , &quot; &quot; Any@@ one who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change he decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the landed Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
&quot; i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by el@@ f@@ meter Müller added another . &quot;
before the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ m@@ ous Bavarian fans had apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich @-@ based hang@@ ers . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smoke , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - that &apos;s why a long @-@ term study suggests that . &quot;
good news : ren@@ oun@@ cement decreases the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; tooth decay causes cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphas@@ ises DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
the link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking is also increasing the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years before the threat reaches the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one has to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained Mr. H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings it also results in good dental health down to the old age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter@@ ing lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; for the next time , archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Monum@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the bou@@ levard of the Rhine , archae@@ ologists have now found five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured in freight train
&quot; after a young woman is caught at the railway station in Germany , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the railway platform , and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Police , she suffered severe injuries by det@@ ecting the train . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
about the reason of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman there is no knowledge of the medi@@ ating function@@ aries .
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ broo@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ th@@ straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) arrive . &quot;

EU Commission proposed new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; for the resolution of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens dare , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the TTIP is intended to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; in concrete terms , the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US have jointly chosen independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
there is also a second instance provided for the first time .
it would allow it to rise against judgement .
&quot; until now , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbitr@@ ators , there was no claim to claim their sentences . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it plans to work towards an international investment court according to its own data . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) above all are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , over which companies can first ride compensation of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was above all critici@@ zed that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German Federal State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission took into consideration major points in the reform that the Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the commercial pi@@ voting possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club of Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells of various places he always records on the map and report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously arranged songs .
where they originated and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative person . &quot;
&quot; published in 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that nest@@ le harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can drift into great opul@@ ent moments at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our arises , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; is the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be followed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece appeared in 2005 .
bor@@ rowing of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experim@@ entation , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic pieces of replacement . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
stage shows become a colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring with Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily held ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs here , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays with the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; plate fundamentally &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; not until an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and eventually bows to thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ ate
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ ate . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works and will start with David Cameron for the first time .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre @-@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance by the media likely and the Labour MPs out of the neighbourhood . &quot;
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip a few sessions to leave her to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several front page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party had originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; stack , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour has proposed changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the Shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss in the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box across Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy set , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ er is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; pun@@ ishments &quot; &quot; and the dispute with re@@ inde@@ er and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy &amp; Ju@@ dy Theatre . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound rose random@@ ly according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and considered estim@@ ation of the timing of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % from the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the stocks of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimate for rating on &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
J@@ D Sports boss says that higher wages are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is currently in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel . &quot;
&quot; construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster is attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her M@@ om E@@ wa earned in half a year . &quot;
if at all .

&quot; I am fulfilling her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;

who ch@@ okes it ?
the fans do not .
even Bi@@ eber himself did not .
that has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for advertisement in the pop @-@ off of the super @-@ club he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account . &quot;

&quot; when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you mar@@ vel at the window pane . &quot;
it is said to have captured more than 100 million people .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
&quot; others stress that , in the United States and Great Britain , Bi@@ eber is on number 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a potato
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - in the Pot@@ ato D@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger stand owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the Lebanese idea has meanwhile been registered with the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer has . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary nations communicate well with his customers too .
met@@ a launches ground @-@ resistance campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ -
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A traders and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy tag . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan discovered that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ a will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ a declined to respond publicly to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 i@@ Gas market share has sun@@ k from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction with simultaneous print on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars in order to compare sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in order to improve their stores with faster @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading schemes of El@@ an will rise and hopes that the wholesale merchant will return to a profit growth for the first time in the year 2017 , for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserved praise for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is often called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee . Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp was disgu@@ sted by Richard Gas@@ quet &apos;s potential US Open victory , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the singles draw behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I really think about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost in the US Open due to a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to take Cy@@ rene at the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he asc@@ ends to the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency status , closes the border , stops refugees &quot;
Hungary declares the state of emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country .
chaos followed the limit when hundreds of migrants landed in a No Man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
&quot; for an unknown period , the people who fled from violence were stuck in a country strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some expelled food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that in the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement was reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an imminent campaign of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insisted that most emerging economies are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in opposition to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve of the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian civil servants also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the border . &quot;
&quot; chaos envel@@ oped the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to manipul@@ ate the data of people and pressed a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; ex @-@ Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by what candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are here only with 5 points . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has become volati@@ le and they and S@@ anders are at the same level .
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the past month Clinton was a two @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic elec@@ tors say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with problems and the practic@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president raises the potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries would like to see him in the race - although one third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bianca decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is against S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call on questions about the legi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries emerged unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates furn@@ ish good results with some important features in elec@@ ting the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t think about it . &quot;
&quot; democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister continues to be satisfied , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have deterior@@ ated by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the elec@@ torate of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent regard it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold it for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights nationwide also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good lead notes . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than tru@@ thful , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times densely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son decreased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and tru@@ mp was sur@@ passed by Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , and of 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising to the p@@ olls - with 19 % support from the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to questioning Tru@@ mps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing holiday@@ makers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; swimming temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student died , murder charges against five persons were submitted for almost two years . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police . &quot;
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , and he was unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposed an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide stuff and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with dul@@ ler force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ ale of the Brotherhood . at least one student died on the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold these to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their belonging to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a raise of interest comes , and the land@@ se will fall , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so heavily that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the inflation cycle and the return on investment will start to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the F@@ ed interest rate .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP since 1950 was only 4.5 % of nominal GDP since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants set up a net interest rate of F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ eh@@ en very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a raise of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that bonds are faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in the case of bonds , the yields appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is eff@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the ascent cycle , the loans return immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large companies , which wind up the larger part of their business operations in the United States , benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed a weak balance sheet after each rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity for their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers want to see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial rivals .
he also went to BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
women &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; conservative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial rivals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also went to BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous mentioned examples where you can only mim@@ ic what &apos;s already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think also really important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it had to be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire to face commercial rivals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he says that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee @-@ pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday stopped spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting itself , and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers visited their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers would fight for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 expenditure a little more than 1 £ was spent online .
&quot; in some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of shopping is now being carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion labels in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the people killed in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first par@@ ach@@ ments in Mec@@ ca , through the streets &quot;
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden &apos;s group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that , in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance Cem@@ etery . &quot;
&quot; the procession of mour@@ ning took place in the Holy Place , where only days before a construction crane fell by the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the praying . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were approved for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , king Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that bin Laden &apos;s group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad may be prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the Grand @-@ Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree did not blame the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is run by the Bin Laden group . &quot;
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people stay hospit@@ alized .
&quot; government officials admitted that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

&quot; British employ increasingly skilled tra@@ des@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people , are opened &quot;

&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ Market chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to shift this to a balance more strongly .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items through women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales , after the group cul@@ minated the costs of closing the stores . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt Regional Court , two officials of the Austrian volleyball laboratory manager A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and secondary education . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with official abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Prosecutor General Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary examination , the defend@@ ants were able to extract funds from the club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; with around 400@@ ,000 euros it is estimated to be damaged . &quot;
sports officials are also charged with financial los@@ ers .
&quot; this fact expi@@ red the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset belonged to the association . &quot;
&quot; sports function@@ aries would have only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities came in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( roughly 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ based tax inspec@@ tor of the financial ministry . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , it must not be made any debt . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in case of corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance was approved retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also l@@ ump sum and not detail @-@ adjusting entries appeared , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ ories managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial services , it is important only debt @-@ freedom has been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the official investigations of official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were provisions , the defend@@ ants asser@@ ted . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said he thought that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary was justified . &quot;
this refer@@ ral has been formulated as &quot; claims settlement . &quot;
&quot; why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the first defend@@ ant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the association had never done any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never obtained a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and diets . &quot;
&quot; he charged 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
&quot; they were no longer stored after an audit in which everything had been correctly judged , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the postpon@@ ements are done in cash , and he explained in his statement from his residence international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main proceedings will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard presents more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff cuts running for three years , the computer terri@@ ers will be able to cut more jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the US computer terri@@ fic He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will rise from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the total breakdown of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot;
listed below were the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share 2.3 percent .
&quot; the corporation , which is expanding with printers from California , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a again dis@@ appointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services , set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues fell back in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more shops online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total breakdown of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly come to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad covers 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
&quot; at the heart of the fair is up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; mobility unites &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide public can attend the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; as two years ago , the organisers of the Auto Association V@@ DA anticipate some 900@@ ,000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; the Hungarian police , on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and the water @-@ thro@@ wer , fought against several hundred deployed refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k had witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind it , a police line was formed and a water @-@ thro@@ wer stood behind the polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles after officials . &quot;
the officials initially set off pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had entered the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried out . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Bosnian press spokesperson also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will wait a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , executive staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death thro@@ wer at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called on the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , He shot a man , and he was put to death . &quot;
&quot; lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre , that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; no one will bother &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were ring@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate from Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; in 150 of the 1,000 executives around the world , group sales will cost the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate an earnings contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline disclosed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a board member for the passenger business . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot placement cockpit ( VI@@ C ) , the negotiations after the court @-@ stopping strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed . &quot;
that divided the union .
the topic of the talks shall be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , the cockpit wanted to come as soon as possible to viable results . &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; saving concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is moving to the Group @-@ owned airline Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this led the left foreign def@@ ensi@@ sts to cry and to exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital .
&quot; he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later , and then operated in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has it very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then lasts six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; based on this , Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
&quot; the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital , after a b@@ oul@@ ar by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot;
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn shortly : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , appeared in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ camp &apos;s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always be a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good except that the following paragraph where Cameron is said to describe the plot of the book , instead recre@@ ates an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral districts .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ side victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; based on this , Adam Ly@@ th deri@@ ves from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss commen@@ ded his attitude , even though he did not achieve such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton received the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; the only repro@@ ach one can lift was that England was first inser@@ ting Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer I highly treasure . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting mos@@ ques beat alongside Cook , what an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler would perform and four Qui@@ cks would get , di@@ ved up and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he made three hundred R@@ uns right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ verns as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the coach . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh breeze , even if the news is consistent with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; collaboration team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disturbing contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summ@@ its or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has been done in the exc@@ essively long endurance as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain has a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not deliberate ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in all his comp@@ act@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ min@@ ting foreigners and the Pseu@@ do Non @-@ In@@ länder , most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about them , but discovered that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he needed no more time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ year years , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ef@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ der of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ i &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow law was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow workers and depu@@ ties after all reports on their postpon@@ ement on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free card for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ i siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load capacity of the data and indicated the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to reflect their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing directors had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing members of the committee are not supplied , but include several famous e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco shop was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s research indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damage to most products in most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative hazards in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former CEO of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded which could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ production . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC in general .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame on hunting for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows give this again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart conference in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks and they can argue when they go to their seem@@ ing missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; at the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value out of this . &quot;
&quot; of course , we all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its Travel Eth@@ ics mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and enter@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial channels will enter alliances to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled from out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they reson@@ ate with sound impulses , which for the human ear have to high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the pul@@ ses work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ az@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said to the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then enter into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ az@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the infected human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence around advertising for the trade fair - and thought , &quot; &quot; Give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; through the single @-@ ring with bright colors and animation it will stick stronger . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture appliances at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture appliances are not traded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to the student residence is from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ atter : people tell wh@@ ence you come from and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly don &apos;t love nor hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out people who like you , in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and risk their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you must go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos tap - do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close through baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate of Brow@@ ni@@ es less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and end up might associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you knock . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check it with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is in jail .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ verb they belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before leaving their own music , closed their door and went to their three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to enter the same residence hall by chance ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be totally embarrass@@ ing if you think a room@@ mate for your future spouse stay at her , dis@@ connect and then see her every day , and perhaps experience how she re@@ treats all mutual friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is fun , but it takes just moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security , but do not miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; holiday homes for refugees , single educ@@ ators , ger@@ many &quot;
real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ valley .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother and the benef@@ actor alone . &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in an interview , &quot; I am showing how to build good and good things today . &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different when someone puts people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have successfully passed my project .
especially complicated makes it the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the plac@@ eholder regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ mined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were some , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
which definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the tut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; I would like to show you how to build a cheap , cheap way today . &quot;
that is what it is all about .

&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch between half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton in the fight for the World Cup title against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Chess Club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member into its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for over 40 times . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which was the chairman of Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot open the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ bure@@ au searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the old @-@ age centre Anton@@ ine have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new place of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
&quot; in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; more specifically , the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established with our ambul@@ ant nursing service that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new hous@@ eholder Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ inus and the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; explained the new owner of the house@@ wife Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers preventive , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the Senior Center for Care and Care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is particularly reflected in the demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) underlined during the inauguration ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age of : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible . &quot;
&quot; the neighborhood office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 am to 12 noon . &quot;

&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the artist house left an honorary member and &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called in the exhibition . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot;

&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only after that I will decide whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot;

men test on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were travelling from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a sevent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station . &quot;
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men scre@@ amed the youth and hit the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a n@@ os@@ ef@@ oot and bled strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his sacrifice . &quot;
the wounded young man was brought home by his friends .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car , up to their home , and passed over there demonstr@@ atively several times . &quot;
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh were taken by the victim , taking the victim &apos;s aid . &quot;
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; up to now , only a v@@ ague perpetr@@ ator description is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice with Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economy , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing in many places in the country : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel &apos;s retirement goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich remains at the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10,000 in the premises on St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lows met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ st@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot;
the German couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one agreed , the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller has also grown up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as senior emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19th , practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the garbage cans , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as home doctors . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of 50,000 euros is given by the land@@ lady as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks each quarter . in North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor has found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , he who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation will continue to look in familiar faces : she takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel pu@@ ck@@ les re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she already felt a little hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still very often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property .
&quot; until now I have always pressed myself before gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also carried on at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Home Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the controls on the Hungarian border remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for a asylum application can do so &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor through the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia refused &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also set up corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , however , the Minister of Home Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the exterior of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government reported , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to stop in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country was counting about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that have so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were travelling all night out of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should travel here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkans @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary seems to be a somewhat further to the west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; has comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have been witn@@ essing a good testimony to the country since then , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , both the Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cross@@ ings continue to be completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees will now continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm on Wednesday early in a local note in Hor@@ gos , keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not at present deal with very high refugee figures .
&quot; they could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers recommend migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchange h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched by the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the proceedings against 32 additional defend@@ ants continued in the case .
most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are alleged to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people take care of their concerns , partly quick steps , partly relaxed stroll . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keeping the city lanes .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce subsi@@ dy brought attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and under men , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ zer is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the voluntary workers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously resorts to the chal@@ k and the sentence &quot; &quot; affir@@ med my life &quot; , &quot; others can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that eventually the end of this world will come to an end , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is in common with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public efficiency action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to inform himself publicly on the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still covered with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people . &quot;

the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ant is one of the voluntary employees of the first hour .
&quot; confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce consul@@ ted by calling volunteers , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ g@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce St. Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ er@@ roid is able to deal with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another vantage point , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance schemes and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ant Gi@@ ant gave his winning outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire approx . 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite higher charges for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; yields solid earnings if we consider weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 per cent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts surv@@ eyed six analysts predicted 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought the turnover in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most awaited session in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spent two days this week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening over them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story seat hall , there is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US occupation and prices here keep stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are seeing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which dis@@ sec@@ ures the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
&quot; financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed regards as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % below its top level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would threaten the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , now the Dow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had failed in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait for at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous . &quot;
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow down its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also provide advice with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA said this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that seem not to be associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varnish , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to raise interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its share by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited perc@@ ei@@ vable impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Deter@@ mination of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence does not come close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate because markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mand@@ ated mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should advance the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a bewil@@ dering number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department when you need engine oil .
&quot; the store is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchase makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has different take @-@ out options .
what it is : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter fish and even fry on demand for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pork sho@@ als , fish balls , local saus@@ ages , commercially prepared foods and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking space . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , do not go without the dedication of countless volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with both body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 l@@ ences .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pedi@@ atric Company Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet is actually affecting the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step @-@ by @-@ step : during the recent council meeting , the completed construction work was unanim@@ ously secured without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the body had decided , among other things , an application for a structural &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof top &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels is : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the ti@@ lt of the roof , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan stipul@@ ated - should lie below 10 degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan did not permit &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; regarding the gn@@ a@@ wing - with the exception of the Bern@@ ese Municip@@ ality rather restric@@ tive in the case of deliver@@ ance orders . &quot;
&quot; in gymnas@@ tics , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot;
the gymnas@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots support .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall will now be presented to the Council &apos;s Office for Ex@@ am@@ ination . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is reflected in the surprising plans of the District Hospital of the county , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the approximately 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who can &apos;t go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik only since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is specialised in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology on the In@@ ner Station .
&quot; for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves both houses , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which still has 35 beds in the next year , shall finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim is completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , advoc@@ ates ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was unable to say that there were several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ was@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better things could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in recent decades the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are called for the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener spent a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and made something good there . &quot;
Jag@@ om@@ ash with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police reported . &quot;
&quot; after a firing @-@ out ceremony , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; it was unclear , at first , how accurate it could have happened . &quot;
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ations ) was established .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was admitted to kill young people and cast their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime since Saturday .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , is indeed considered to be suspected and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning , after she had not come home after a visit to the autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first found the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the boy@@ friend and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old finally emerged . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and laid the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put his death toll on him . &quot;
further investigations are to be brought to the conclusion about the closer circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable pen@@ cils .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social @-@ H@@ ousing Construction .
&quot; by comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers came to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a flat deficit , which is growing by year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there are already some 77@@ ,000 units in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people lived in large cities with no need to live in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be temporarily suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding program for refugees &apos; accommodation in Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees choose their way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing its transit across Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Home Secretary , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the sh@@ ot@@ ting of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws which entered into force on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary almost superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to allow refugees to happen .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach the border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the border stri@@ ves other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , hardly more refugees arrive after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws rank the breach and damage of the B@@ order Guard as a crime .
35 p@@ uni@@ tive procedures have therefore been initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungary border town .
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; - almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
lock@@ smi@@ ths were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instruction of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing up when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the flow of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the borders together with two other assistants and their cars over the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have only once dressed the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we have said right away we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded migr@@ atory passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to find it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still crossing the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , tags earlier a two @-@ brid@@ ging sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately upon the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly supported the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ ist circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; , &quot; which invited them and welcomed them , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the continued influ@@ x of refugees and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has to do all the work . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place districts for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first commissioning centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless friends in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ tices , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ work . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad comp@@ utes with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 will deliver the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial leaders .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s fine in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that arti@@ san@@ ers must respect a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the superior . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be applied . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is successful in accommod@@ ating accommodation , Konrad establishes with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the republic , as they explained themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their head@@ count on three to four .
&quot; up to now , our own loc@@ ating search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better seg@@ mentation
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban spor@@ es and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for accommod@@ ating refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected parties are currently unable to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the city &apos;s principal on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday massac@@ red further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the further departure of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the protective @-@ seekers , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once more demanded more solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , too , that Austria again leads controls on its borders , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; New Shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Swoboda . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the new Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the New Shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is desp@@ ised by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on vene@@ er hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jutta has wanted to breed a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has gained additional growth in the form of another local area . &quot;
&quot; the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop selling bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers is now all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it has been rebuilt several weeks earlier .
&quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking long about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist woman cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called ant@@ lers .
&quot; some people associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
&quot; whether he expresses himself xen@@ opho@@ bic , touches journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office bu@@ ys the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts well on it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fres@@ ur is a concept many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village are related to him over -@@ zig corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) as well - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he did not bring it there . &quot;
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , it tends to think that &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the anch@@ ors .
&quot; the success story of Tru@@ mp started in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather im@@ migr@@ ated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group were first real estate acquisitions in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed by the Bavarian State , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Ga@@ el@@ ic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly compla@@ ined about Mexican im@@ migrant in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of the shri@@ mps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born baby ch@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz . &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement views the Americans rather distant , &quot; he is always so blat@@ ant . &quot;
does he think that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pension Ac@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not gain the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , and the interest in the USA is also awak@@ ened . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; villages . &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have at least 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son reach Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report in connection with the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today Reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull crossed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the board didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in recent months , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 took place . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators up to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect those early people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recent wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the outcome of last night answered with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , showed an average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia took 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly reveal who wins the Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man , giving his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a very simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pre @-@ reserved to him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then it was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests for their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League converter did on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scor@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first game district of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin Debut in 2007 when a passport reached a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

free voters demand the setting up of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high refugee figures .
&quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn holiday in Greater Wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers according to the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to guard the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get offen@@ se in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of free voters is conven@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; A@@ ï@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia @-@ wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to deal with the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters &quot; boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we would need uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot;
but the country politics in the city of W@@ ann@@ see should not fall under the table .
a long term standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ stufe C1 , &quot; which will test an extension of the high school secondary school from three to four years . &quot;

fix Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on jumps
&quot; after a long run , the German stock market has closed a seamless and nervous trading process with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a firm start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
M@@ DA@@ X middle @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the Tec@@ Da@@ x technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the euro area Euro@@ sto@@ xx 50 , as the Eurozone &apos;s leading market , declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also shed light on trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted some 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock markets assume that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the large decline in the dates on this Friday .
&quot; in the meantime , RW@@ E &apos;s shares have been de@@ pressed for a record low and also leaving E@@ on deep lanes . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; , German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot;

&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares climbed by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors from the German chip manufacturer paid little attention at this time . &quot;
investment in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA voted for the launch of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the Daimler and BMW drivers grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on stock exchange securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federal Government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the price of the euro dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; towards the south , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal told the police to use tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last two weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rec@@ i say that new provinces that are formed as part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there have also been protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ us who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square @-@ square @-@ meter property in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Old Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; you wait for appropriate offers , that is , on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , already a few months ago and the building was torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of a holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time the investor made public plans for the project .
some residents are more worried - they fear the sale of their free time tre@@ k
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gr@@ asp@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; interest@@ ingly , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; system construction , &quot; unveiled its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ingly went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
&quot; for months , the project has been deb@@ ated in the discussion about ten to twelve million Euros . &quot;
&quot; violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the images and new details about the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; in the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , Roberto Schulz lam@@ ents : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears certain other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all the Bus@@ es must come to pay for it , &quot; &quot; said Martin Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ung . &quot;
&quot; because this was missing , the development plans were even more variable . &quot;

Google launches double @-@ donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund @-@ raising campaign aimed at helping thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud , a Google employee , fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also escape from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
reporting by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity treatments have proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c lau@@ ch@@ ising - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes completely only dis@@ b@@ anded by one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the guiding expl@@ orer Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ scopy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have tightly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently attracting more attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe could not accommodate all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide asked for the end of violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which focuses on ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that , under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how killing in their countries is dimin@@ ished . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and stated that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swallow hard alcohol dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of revenues of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 reported poison control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let si@@ p whis@@ ky lying around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children and if children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of fragrance dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is regarded as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had stum@@ bled across the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario killed women after swal@@ lowing hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; teacher by laying down anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; said a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them from their space .
the police considered the vain plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action to the school authorities .

&quot; Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the d@@ unge@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays out talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader of the table . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football te@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ bru@@ ker and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic music , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland there are no highlights in the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ ger .
you are talking about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggle must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ells to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points ahead of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Celtic because it makes the players better .
standing now is so important .

&quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; the players who come in the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton .
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which have not won games of this kind either . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is increasing in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July with 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the Bureau of National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish employment market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January above his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will see it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; shape it better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a report by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .

&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful , when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a break @-@ in incident at Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me &apos; , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship soccer player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy says that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integration Unit of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cobal@@ t @-@ test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back eighte@@ en months for the es@@ pi@@ onage alle@@ gations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; look like to high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I spent a long time on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had carried out the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave even more cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and put away my license , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been based on the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching concluded that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the Sunday @-@ treatment rule &quot; lu@@ di@@ cro@@ us &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ its , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my associates has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the same yesterday all day .
but it was the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver cur@@ sed arrest
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and driver cur@@ sed driver in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway . &quot;
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police came to Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be charged for driver cur@@ ses and under@@ las@@ si@@ ding assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits against rivals because of claims on ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of tac@@ kling his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring Stru@@ g@@ gles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed comment to the Storm team , after his team had scored the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; with the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was hop@@ eful that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . however , over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock to him . &quot;
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the 2010 Premier League with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we look at as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I trust stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are p@@ auses , and do not make any points a thing ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; serving $ 200,000 Guarant@@ eed for Drug Ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who may have threatened a lifel@@ ong sentence for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and lod@@ ged in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the Sailing Har@@ bor during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly lifel@@ ong penalty for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been from a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ent explanations of the two individuals it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gave off his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reported to the police every day and keeps himself at an initial lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police reported . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab torn apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep lo@@ aned into an online mess@@ aging service by which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she looked through , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for Ho@@ gg not to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the floo@@ ding were caused by fear of the discovery and arrest of the people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river Inn River Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and traffic tubes to the German side .
&quot; there they are received from the Federal Police , and forwarded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; at Munich &apos;s main station , there were clearly more refugees arriving after federal police statements compared to the weekly beginning on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : runner from the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; expected in the southwest &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; Henry , &quot; dropping from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic Ocean in the past days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , it can also be expected in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea rice with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement among the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone , according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , a large number of new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the major premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is Opel Astra , which will be sold to dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel presents a new entry under the VW Golf &apos;s biggest competitor , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time even three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA : new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan de@@ posit@@ ors want to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger were especially interested in front parti@@ tions : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was especially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a series of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the rev@@ amped Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected may even hope for money if they were locked only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was lod@@ ged in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his attorney , was now back on a free base , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his prison term due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for further testing . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; for legal reasons , even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al now has to clarify the amount of dental damage .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; so they spoke only in April to a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell in the nude . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which a prisoner had reached a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the then plain@@ ti@@ ff had lived between 15 and 21 hours a day , between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin have also come into the head@@ lines because of the lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which climbs aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ cket shall already have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young shortage , 19 shall fall in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is to be done in Germany ?
&quot; some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after predic@@ tions by the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the un@@ common challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; much too little is that from the viewpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing units would have to be created annually , and the federal government would have to invest a level of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , scientists and Federal Minister of Industry agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically after their qualification to help them when they started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says refugee researcher Dietrich Colonel Burk@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ one , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation that asylum seekers are confined to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled personnel , the point of view is enforced mostly by the fact that refugees should be made possible faster to access the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
research also shows that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is based on the view from the Thr@@ one of the Royal Road to the integration of labour . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ z@@ ek , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators to rise strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes on the classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ utz from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in principle no Federal State prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance . &quot;
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence or tolerance do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they start a course of study . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the board . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled to ban B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this will shor@@ ten to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , but require Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state ought to succ@@ essively enter the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state church law to a new state religion ratio . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wohl@@ fahrts@@ verband that takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; to this end , it is also a readiness to take advantage of religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to squee@@ ze such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a subject of society as a whole . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a universal gender equality law for a decade . &quot;
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored in the police and the authorities .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and non @-@ white German advoc@@ ates have long been calling for and what international agreements , such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany , have to become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical services to the expected refugees , the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; regarding man@@ y- power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand over all the newcom@@ ers at the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to collect as many people with the limited range of services prescribed by the asylum seek@@ er law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barrier to be created . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , she demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already helped many more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the medical triangle , the refugees may even be seen as allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees even were physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass on ex@@ ams again . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleeping and concentration disorders , severe el@@ ong@@ ation and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Dr. Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to capture every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the arena invites you to dream on a brick kil@@ n .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , teacher and junior director . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of managers .
the circus in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for enthusiasts is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior director . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban Duo wants to take up loos@@ ely . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer the hearts of women in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and ag@@ ility . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the posture of cir@@ c@@ uses are all too often subject to different animal protection organizations .
&quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we do not go well too . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every car@@ ess unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , are read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; the animal does not feel comfortable , nor does it want to go into the arena . &quot;
&quot; so , the top command is : good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Festival . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , something is likely to be there . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether 5 or 1 200 people , we always give our best and with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst starting from September 17th to 20th every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm . &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are dis@@ counted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , daily the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , they had de@@ bu@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesperson for democratic change movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; he told journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers posed by politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 working jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will later divide into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies can deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb in front of the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that has not healed well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as little recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developing an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 League Games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which experienced most injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al ki@@ cks off its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep balance and give players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with a scale of 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the hope of leading the club to its first European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked out in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever has become , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common among men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , aiming to question the culture that men hin@@ ders to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; healthy spirits &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you first have to have friends to make a friendship . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life doubles the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football glance in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that males can relate to it , even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing I explained : ... &quot; &quot; I really showed myself how the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference to me . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair - the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop to celebrate the day totally re@@ designed backdrop , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Peru . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria met to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes her debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only aim for the knock @-@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , there was no clas@@ h of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chance in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing lob@@ ster was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished past Johan Wil@@ and beautifully in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who beat the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was hit by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field , a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ atz@@ ted in the first half in no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shooting , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth Se@@ as@@ ant , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot;
the skill games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game from them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion dollars by stock sales
&quot; based in Switzerland , Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , affected by collap@@ sing resource prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a stock sales as part of its huge debt plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core company , registered in London , stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of reference rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores stock &apos;s stock in trading on the early wed@@ nes@@ days a spe@@ edy increase to the tip of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion $ debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;

XI whose visit was first announced in February is expected to arrive in Seattle to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before traveling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi can address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times tro@@ phy winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion league winner , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he stood before the European Championship in 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ana was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola , and I have played a great European Championship . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of movies
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown was interrupted when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown responded by sho@@ cking with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ l Brothers in order to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - as they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - it KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter scored national @-@ wide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to apply discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured populations . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted the invitation , or had already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and control help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which recently completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who finished all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; to the final task , the climbing rig belonged to a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still below the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac e ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes ; it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received mass of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had sli@@ pped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IST - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to ascend in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 3 R@@ uns 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger cap Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ man @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the punch ball well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( impact training ) , notic@@ e@@ ably better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ ding By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escap@@ es a two @-@ run rift with the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit had added a Insurance Run at the end of the 9th Inn@@ ings , Wall scored an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed guy , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit formed the pr@@ elu@@ de to the game of an even non moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first one , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers posted in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the limbs .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to fight the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing from the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in question are to be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily suspended .
they should then be transferred to other commun@@ es .
&quot; over the past ten days , some 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen , according to the District Court of Govern@@ mental Govern@@ ments responsible for the first time . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures an option in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive re@@ thinking about military options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective action . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup had passed by military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive up@@ surge of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has also re @-@ established controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF , no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks in this regard between the General Director for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route . &quot;
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann jointly submitted a special summit for next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , Angela Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening following almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; under@@ lining Merkel , those people who need protection , also complain . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge effort of strength . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck in the Balkans . &quot;
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced its intention to seal the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asive maneu@@ vers over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants arrived in Turkey on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space prob@@ es &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
these include researchers from observations of the Raum@@ son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its run@@ way around the ring plan@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; although this movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous solid esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; Cass@@ ini had already discovered ic@@ ec@@ an volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Saturn Moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; the extent of the hidden ocean , however , was not resolved . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association divided . &quot;
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis &quot; probably means four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a former loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of an un@@ itary professional . &quot;
&quot; however , as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to step into running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured herself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) during a violent clas@@ h at the head .
&quot; contrary to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - above all su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits therefore support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel color alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ gos very tasty .
store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS again supplies up to 9@@ 5000 euros for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought in harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ado , then marked cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alpine fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz transm@@ its on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the gro@@ wer @-@ valleys .
&quot; after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stream . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the mountain , on the night of Wednesday , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up until Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ nt@@ valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adic@@ ally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ eh@@ n can advance to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even or@@ cs of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , F@@ öhn runs for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away from the slope . &quot;
here is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected to the south of the Alps . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n takes off the air , and in consequence a cold front is rolling with a powerful , partly thunder@@ storm rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind is blowing strongly to stor@@ my speed , and temperatures return significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees Celsius . in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the south . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the consortium of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the pop@@ es over the centuries . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a ruined sin@@ ful ba@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome . &quot;
&quot; with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ las@@ sh@@ al trade , Luther began the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental Church . &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) village crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written and updated the Bible text .
in the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subj@@ ectively artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles are created that dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or father@@ land . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar , and so translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant sovereign Order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane @-@ stock , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work on it , perhaps to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to return art again in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is characterized today by advertisement and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into &quot; &quot; the images , let them work , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed to the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; &quot; I like him to live with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not paid attention to the complete collection of the Bible , but also selected topics that are important for him , including mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler vom Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th . &quot;
construction starts for BM@@ X railway commen@@ ces
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned , Earth &apos;s Hill model@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already an end . &quot;
&quot; failure in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train . &quot;
&quot; thus hills moved up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; approval in October , the first church leader Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga places a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football responds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say that in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must interest everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday , I am in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Secretary of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and would help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must pose the policy .
&quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; at the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will be entitled to &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos; Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee tragedy goes on , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use the Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our bril@@ liance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale to play the European Championships against Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their own locations was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will jointly organize 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees with the German Federal Government ( DF@@ B ) and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP board of directors loses an eye in accidents
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , he was power@@ less , he went out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was in attendance at the meeting and &quot; fully able to work . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am fully for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ thing can happen to everyone . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you are fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except battles ...

&quot; as a result , the second race driver Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired during the weekend in Singapore last weekend , just as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus versus Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high stress of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his stem position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of tribal brothers Roman Br@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the So@@ ccer teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe League games , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement of Mit@@ player R@@ eus , that the final one for the B@@ V@@ B must be the target for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl sees : &quot; with that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany is expected to be a technological pioneer in the change of cars . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ aton IAA from a &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and take care of less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of industry at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stressed , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy conversion to digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use it internationally for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars to be lifted from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has until now only envis@@ aged people as drivers . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways until 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving @-@ less vehicles on public roads will be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD Vice @-@ President , S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; as a result , only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent of the traffic on the motorway , in traffic jams , could be 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team @-@ and @-@ stop at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title fight , the Düsseldorf Congress wishes to only strike in the single individual from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; that &apos;s a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ builder Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing event in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ y Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should base ourselves on that , &quot; explained the world ranking fifth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United made a serious injury to the right leg .
&quot; during the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he was stuck in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past , it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his initially lo@@ amy attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; he was actually on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history , without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete artwork , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ inge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have drawn 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather trousers out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught himself to throw fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
Je@@ well@@ ery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it worked on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meter . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , who used them for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the patent office in P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt speci@@ fies some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past pins , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not serve niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , the P@@ lau@@ en company is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
there are no translations available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and are sold almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , export is weaker , currently in Russia and in the United States . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery mil@@ eage in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; for this year we have been running a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ er@@ isches Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace embroi@@ dery .
&quot; to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; at some places , the machine ticks small chi@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the pl@@ um gold@@ smith Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tops . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze : young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays the magic kid &apos;s girl 20 years after the first film . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone playing P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; advancing new spin @-@ offs and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to record private capital , and over@@ haul the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not question investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved through test programs .
&quot; the initiative is important since it points to the market a major role in the allocation of resources , a right @-@ wing business environment is assured and the market is more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on powers transmitted to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli joined the meeting as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to mi@@ tig@@ ate the consumer a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be passed on to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t at Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic policy &quot; &quot; should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 percent of catches cannot be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to Food@@ watch intends to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they meet the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre , which alone helps the economy , &quot; explained wolf @-@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal pois@@ oning for humans that is heavily enriched in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage in terms of the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; should not be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly transported to the environment by burning coal .
&quot; according to a written reference by the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; long @-@ lasting and widespread , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
