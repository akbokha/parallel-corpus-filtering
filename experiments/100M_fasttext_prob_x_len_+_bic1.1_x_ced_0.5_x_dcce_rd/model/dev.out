Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu hosted a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Front in front of the U.S. Congress which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor decided to shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that lamb , who had been in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already submitted 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that universities have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised lamb , said he was also a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met with friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years trying to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch watch , while the university choir &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang . &quot;
the lesson will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associate Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributing to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor power for the Christmas season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products retailer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it would plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees from October to December is increasing . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to employ time @-@ workers to equip shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated G@@ äh@@ nen and a length of it away from being with the princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time @-@ travel movie ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the Minist@@ erial Meeting of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at surveys down , it has ( still ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son just manages the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see the tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their guide , Republi@@ can voters uph@@ old Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten will say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters will see the Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership , while anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority of support . &quot;
&quot; he has scored 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp will say they have confirmed their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was calling for an im@@ migrant from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; two months ago , Donald Tru@@ mp was the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do it too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a re@@ building house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - hence the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter is the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro per square meter , mind @-@ marked . &quot;
&quot; but good , who can afford it ... &quot;
&quot; by the way , Munich is here exceptionally not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ po@@ acher in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller smooth@@ ed the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller received gra@@ cious assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion as a f@@ lange . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , including renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven Euro @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but often to un@@ com@@ promis@@ ingly to work with their aggressive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through earlier Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; from the right , Müller had more luck than his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper side of the gate . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pole of the Pole from the line ( 26th ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct taking , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ted with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had their usual domin@@ ating play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put needle @-@ stal@@ ks . &quot;
but at Tor@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
&quot; for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye about the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ leg@@ ged chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat outside at first . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero first gave the green light after the final training session , said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , he decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slain Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it . &quot;
before the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with ki@@ cks against the Munich @-@ based supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smoke , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam . &quot;
the good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing the risk is reduced quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ing sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ dam@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; explained Professor H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health until high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists arrive at Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Monum@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to remnants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with about 350 graves had been discovered which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by train
&quot; after a young woman is caught up at the railway station in the direction of Gei@@ dd@@ les@@ chen Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform , and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by recording the train , she suffered severe injuries from the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and was brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , the middle officials don &apos;t have any knowledge . &quot;
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ th@@ straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; for the tough@@ ening of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; stated Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström , Commissioner responsible for the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to develop with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; in concrete terms , the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against judgement .
&quot; until now , the parties involved agreed among each other on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court according to its own information . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe , the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , over which companies can first ride compensation of tax pa@@ yers to negotiate national laws or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act designated the Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it was critici@@ zed above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European business association , Business@@ Europe , warned against limiting the economic issues of the economy by too many new rules . &quot;
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer available .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was sitting on stage in the Prime Club of Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken from St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
he tells you about various places he always records on the map and report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative person . &quot;
&quot; published in 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift at any time into the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; is the first part of a we@@ a@@ geable series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be followed in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity to the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and breaks very positively . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician lives back to the series in New York . &quot;
with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 .
bri@@ gh@@ tening ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens will then rely on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth neat studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long ago the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .

&quot; he presents himself mainly the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs here , the clearly rei@@ fer St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays with the broad@@ ened album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can thus disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; record basically &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually tends to fall under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unda
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unda is expected to be eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from close proximity . &quot;
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several titles of titles in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour &apos;s changes are taking place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy set , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works are confron@@ t@@ ational and that he has both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with re@@ inde@@ er and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle that the shadow economy minister is represented in him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the House of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgement of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound grows through accelerated growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound increased as a result of data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and produced assessments on the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimate for rating on &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .

&quot; others stress that , in the United States and the UK , Bi@@ eber will be on number 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to Pot@@ o@@ don@@ er &apos;s idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - in the m@@ ashed potato , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ nick owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his store , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Lebanese idea has meanwhile been registered with the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y it . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes well with its customers .
met@@ cash ki@@ cks off ground @-@ insur@@ gency campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in the run up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia constitute almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley appreciated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan has found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s revenue in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , the market share has dropped by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction in both sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler is reluct@@ ant to invest more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in order to improve their stores with faster @-@ growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s principal managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading schemes of El@@ an will grow , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and deserves praise from the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came to the spotlight by the not@@ orious exploration of St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka by the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ f promised a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite busy is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to take a car into consideration when deciding on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he asc@@ ends to the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency state , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declares the emergency and ri@@ dd@@ les the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country .
chaos followed the limit when hundreds of migrants landed in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some expelled food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days there must be talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a stringent meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency state issued on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the emerging economies are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos envel@@ oped the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news pol@@ l , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s benefit in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton still has a big advantage over the older voters .
&quot; in the past month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the previous elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the Demo@@ crat voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
permission to deal with problems and the practic@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters in the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons &apos;s tra@@ ilers , more than half of them say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage increases from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement by far , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Demo@@ crat voters call on questions about the legi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate emerged as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in choosing the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 per cent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of ten who say their views from Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the elec@@ tors of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good notes in the lead . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as being honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located close to Donald Tru@@ mp at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and tru@@ mp under republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker who has fallen the deepest , and of 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ oboam and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located at 6 % in the third place . &quot;
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a look at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing holiday@@ makers is enough to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bath temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons were submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood resor@@ ted to Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police . &quot;
officials said he had been loaded with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide stuff and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police officer Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with dul@@ ler force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ ale of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold these to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their belonging to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest will come , and the house will sink , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the business process . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset accounts recei@@ vable 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raise interest , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the re@@ perc@@ ussions on the shares tend to occur later in the infl@@ or@@ escence cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only fell twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few are expected to continue and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants set up the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing very quickly after the onset of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first raise / decrease occurs in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the ascent cycle , the loans return immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in increasing yields between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , however , that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger portion of their business operations in the United States will benefit from this when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increasing dollar boo@@ sts their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react very positively , three months after initial interest increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet recorded a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial rivals .
he also went to BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something the private traveler does not do . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think also really important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience when it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for the commercial rivals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins resor@@ ted to The Voice , the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the tax@@ pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday stopped spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
experts say there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when purch@@ as@@ ers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting itself , and we will possibly experience that the growth will be less@@ ened . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times marked the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers would fight for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of 5 £ a little more than 1 £ was spent online .
&quot; in some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of shopping is now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the huge Sau@@ dis Bin Laden
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed , as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ ckery collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance Cem@@ etery . &quot;
&quot; the procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king made a san@@ ction for the construction company of Bin Laden because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , king Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that bin Laden &apos;s bin Laden was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the big mo@@ ckery , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has not published any statements on the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal decree also imp@@ acted the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is run by the Bin Laden group . &quot;
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials admitted that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injured are half of this amount .

&quot; because Brit@@ ons are increasingly employing handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markets chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services for grav@@ ure prices , has meanwhile been over@@ taken . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men were out@@ weighing the men . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this to a balance more strongly .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group cul@@ minated the costs of closing the stores . &quot;
&quot; because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt Regional Court , two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ warding . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for office abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the defend@@ ants had collected funds from the association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; at about 400@@ ,000 euros , the damage has been estimated . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial results .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that there was no asset in the association at any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries had only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had spent much time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money , in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( about 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ based tax inspec@@ tor of the financial ministry . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there may be no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the allowance compens@@ ations had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , pau@@ lin and not detail covers also appeared , the former Ob@@ server explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ ories managed the two defend@@ ants together , the second accused said . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial services , it is important that only debt @-@ free has been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and according to his statement , the association was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
&quot; after all , he thought that he was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , justified himself to the function@@ ary . &quot;
this refer@@ ral has been formulated as a &quot; claim indem@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this formulation since the association was never a damage to the association . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he merely calculated mil@@ eage and diets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ eting , he charged the association 1.000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years were not able to show the defend@@ ants .
&quot; they were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the exercises are done in cash , and in his statement he explained in his statement from his residence international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main proceedings will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard puts more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff reduction that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the US computer terri@@ fic He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around EUR 2.7 billion , which will rise from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the loss of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has become large with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , currently spl@@ its up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the most promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a again dis@@ appointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues fell back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly come to rejection : 54 percent said , on the other hand , 35 percent were agre@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
24 per cent is opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
&quot; a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 percent were not able to decide .

&quot; as two years ago , the organisers of the Auto Association V@@ DA expect about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : conflict of violence at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water designers , the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and a water @-@ laun@@ cher was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set off pe@@ pper@@ ing spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees caught up in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokesman suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will wait a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior assistant at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death thro@@ es at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his pe@@ ers later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called on the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency department that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
lamb admitted no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were ring@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen pick him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who lost their luck charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a board member for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the roof of the Air@@ line group , which represents the three @-@ quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stopping strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , &quot; &quot; cockpit aims to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision , the pilot is the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa Cargo is paying off to the Group &apos;s own equity line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left foreign def@@ enders to the weeping and won him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old sha@@ w turned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic playing , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then lasts six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the im@@ position of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

&quot; with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a throw from Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read about my children , because it seems to always be an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead recre@@ ates an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , fulfilled , &quot; &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ ficially and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment through the cov@@ eted lau@@ rels , a ho@@ cking , fri@@ vol@@ ous being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a runner @-@ up .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; based on this , Adam Ly@@ th deri@@ ves from the UK @-@ test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss commen@@ ded his attitude even though he did not get such good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and move .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England was first inser@@ ting Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales came in , and he &apos;s a drummer I highly treasure . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of making Mo@@ een next to Cook , what an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler would perform and four squ@@ e@@ aks would get , di@@ ved up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my earlier te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately abol@@ ished three hundred laps and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
&quot; people may see their statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England made some wise additions to the coach . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the news is in tune with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from UK from the EU ) could gain access , if the economy is in a loud noise by 2017 . &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ postpon@@ ed new negotiation strategy to hold the UK in the EU will go deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who has viol@@ ently stri@@ pped himself for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at re@@ port@@ edly said that some member states , as deeply ens@@ nar@@ ed in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own fault , Britain itself created an agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful notes , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press one , as it did not support our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ unity , who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his comp@@ act@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ ali@@ ens , most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about them , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributing ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him , rather than to become his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed the referendum of Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a che@@ es@@ y on Monday in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ year years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow law was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow men and depu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the gru@@ es@@ ome bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ral campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ i siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the report last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and indicated the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to reflect their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding which he should have received according to reports previously from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several famous e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco shop was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; is indicated that there is a lack of &quot; hard proof for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there has been no evidence until now that e @-@ cigarettes have been &quot; premature &quot; as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers .
&quot; Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence is , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders says former CEO of Channel 4
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ disputed time@@ frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and of transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC gives or sends programs that would be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax schemes are financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame on the hunt for reviews &apos; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows give this again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks and they can argue when they go to their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; at the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ caster alliances in order to make everything online available . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction of the moment in which they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
&quot; pul@@ ses work by turning on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then enter into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ az@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light which has to be revealed on a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the infected human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the trade fair - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; through the single @-@ ring with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture appliances at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture appliances are not traded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
&quot; eleven years ago , I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have offen@@ ded - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ tively up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ utter : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly don &apos;t love Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people who you like in contrast to those you would not talk , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and cover their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not remember to start at university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos hook : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closing through che@@ eks .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a little bit baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is in jail .
you should not make any noise that keeps people away from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it makes them a little bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you are a room@@ mate for your future spouse , to ran@@ som them and see them again and see them every day , and perhaps experience how they over@@ take all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is more fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good place is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security , but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; holiday homes for refugees , single educ@@ ators , t@@ anning agents &quot;
&quot; the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people , who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the only educ@@ ating Mother and the Ger@@ sh@@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in the interview , &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good one today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheap living space can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different when someone puts people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be easily changed according to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I made my project legally binding .
especially complicated makes it always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau and the Stell@@ ako Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ represented , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
there is no room for this in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were some , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true is true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but they were built in luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the poor . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and cheap one today .
that is what it is about .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , type on &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by adding the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg is in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Chess Club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for over 40 times . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which was the chairman of Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot get the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search will also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
&quot; in addition to consulting , you can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation runs it down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
a new headquarters office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , right next to the shopping market , immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are so many questions .
&quot; also , many services are not often used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both drivers particularly in demographic change .
this is a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) underlined during the inauguration ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the unification of the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; this makes the social foundation a great contribution , that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot;

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were travelling from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a sevent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
&quot; on the grounds of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot;
one of these men scre@@ amed the youth and hit the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg and bled strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and passed over there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any longer , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a dru@@ m@@ stick , one looked at the face and the th@@ igh of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a v@@ ague perpetr@@ ator description is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters large .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; the joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economy , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing happiness : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing on the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first glance , when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their professional training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the Müller liked the idea to practice his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one agreed , the land@@ lords bought the house with the practice . &quot;
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed as senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss is being prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the garbage cans , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home doctors . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ free EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50,000 euros is given by the land@@ lady as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l about 2,000 patients each quarter come into practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the chem@@ ist remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers consultations , also looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reminis@@ cing with a smile . &quot;
&quot; a little melanch@@ oly , she already felt after the long time . &quot;
&quot; but we are still staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pressed myself before gardening , now this could become different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; the border controls are now also set up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants an asylum application can do it &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor through the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia refused &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also build corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , however , the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; rather , Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily regulated as the exterior of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not willing to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government reported , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country with about 4,000 refugees will reck@@ on , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that have so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , revers@@ ed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were travelling all night out of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; one of the refugees said . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , the postpon@@ ement of the current Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a little further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call it details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; full potential for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since been consistently presenting a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees will now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local note in Hor@@ gos , keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not at present deal with very high refugee figures .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der business should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched by the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trial against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .

ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim has been established for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .

they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously turns to the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; read my life &quot; , &quot; others can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , on the edge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is in common with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to publicly express themselves on the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open themselves . &quot;

&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was requested by calling honorary official , she immediately reported to her and had been there when she was founded in 1995 . &quot;

they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ er@@ roid is good with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , keep it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance schemes and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ant .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended financial prospects for 2016 reduced
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant sen@@ sed his winning prospects for a whole year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tions . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; despite the price increases , the lower view will be 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; yields solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 per cent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts predicted six of Z@@ acks expected to be $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ate . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strategy spent two days this week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a mur@@ al of the United States is located at an end of the ver@@ itable , two @-@ story session hall . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are observing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase of the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed considers to be full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now almost 10 % below the average of May . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins on this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered turbul@@ ences around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but are also advised by other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that , apparently , are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varn@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to raise interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives dismissed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Deter@@ mination of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , do not go without the dedication of countless volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with both body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 l@@ ences .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which su@@ ck in breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : during the recent council meeting the elabor@@ ated construction work was unanim@@ ously secured without major discussions .
&quot; prior to this , the body had decided to apply for a &quot; &quot; legislative &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was given permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof roof &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is : &quot; we get a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the gn@@ a@@ wing , which for energetic reasons - different from the construction plan - should lie under ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the construction plan with regard to the til@@ ting of the roof did not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council generally is rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , the gym is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the expense , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band sports promotion .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ large hall will now be presented to the Council of Agriculture . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seen by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
&quot; for the next two years , when the Supervisory Board agrees to this , both houses will lead , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , shall finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what I close . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better things could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; said Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positively and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in recent decades the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded today in the evening ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener spent a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something good there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police reported . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; at first , how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear . &quot;
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Police ) was established .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Vic@@ tims of Viol@@ ence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was admitted to kill young people and cast their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police were hur@@ ried on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , was also suspected of being active and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to the autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the officer told the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him in charge of death . &quot;
the further investigation will bring about the close circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing short@@ ages
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; for this result , a study commissioned by the Association &apos;s Association for Social housing . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come to the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also makes significant reductions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is going to move an apartment deficit which will grow by year to year .
&quot; currently some 77@@ ,000 units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ ated in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel M@@ um &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market .
&quot; in large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be temporarily suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the funding program for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is already good in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 18@@ 4 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary anymore , since more and more refugees choose their way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Home Secretary , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet at the border fence . &quot;
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , there are hardly more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws rank against the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore introduced in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; practically , however , no one has a view to get asylum granted in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side last week .
lock@@ ers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing up when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , as W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have only once dressed up the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to find it after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try across the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , tags previously a two @-@ piece run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the establishment of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has moved up formally and publicly to the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ a@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; the poultry will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try quarters &quot;
&quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has fully to do all his hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already been able to get a grip on the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first commissioning centre .
&quot; we have no homeless friends in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad comp@@ utes with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will deliver the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial captains .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , to create quarters . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations on the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that district providers must meet a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the duties . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad lived with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their head@@ count on three to four .
&quot; so far , our own neighbourhood search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for accommod@@ ating refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected persons can be accommodated without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism exercises the chief of the city on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday massac@@ red further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the protective @-@ seekers , however , were brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once called for more solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , that now also Austria again leads controls , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the industrial line of Linz is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is listed , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be hired for young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the New Shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ habit@@ ant opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta has wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the &quot; &quot; Tau@@ ben@@ markt &quot; &quot; ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained additional growth in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , all around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long considered whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the last security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; this property also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
&quot; whether he expresses himself xen@@ opho@@ bic , as regards journalists or reveal knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ i@@ dency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts well on it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fres@@ ur is a concept many in the wine village at the wine route .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village are related to him via -@@ zig corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tends to think that &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; the story of Tru@@ mp began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , where the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; trust is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements by the descendants .
he repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa of Op@@ a was born Heinz . &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more distant to the Americans , &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot;
does he think that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not gain the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe , even without President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian Community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain clim@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain clim@@ ber &quot; may have more than 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the Today Reviews . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the Executive Board didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as the Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , in recent months , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today , Today the average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 was compared with the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recent wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the outcome of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before they checked out three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have reli@@ ed on the ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and named his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the game of the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible , and I thought it throughout the show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pre @-@ reserved for him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ gle so as the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League converter did at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly reinforced Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scor@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin debut then in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high refugee figures .
&quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn holiday in Greater Wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get gra@@ p@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the free elec@@ torate conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were envis@@ aged . &quot;
but the record number of refugees also dominates the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria as they gave them during the war in Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to deal with the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also asked more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we would need uniform standards in the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics in the big wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
many years of permanent bur@@ ners are on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; &quot; in 47 grammar schools . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want to .
&quot; free drive at G@@ 9 , wherever desired . &quot;
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps da@@ x on jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits over wide stretches of trend @-@ free and nervous trading history .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a firm pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock markets ensured a clear direction that the Da@@ x ultimately contributed by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X middle @-@ sized figures gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the Tec@@ Da@@ x technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , as the market leader in the euro area , declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock markets account for the fact that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday .
&quot; the discussion about the load from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the stock of RW@@ E to record a record low , and also left its mark on E@@ on &apos;s deep traces . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors on German chip builders paid little attention . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditional weak summer month of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA was announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers from Daimler and BMW grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on stock exchange listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the price of the euro dropped to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 People killed after police rubber bul@@ lets shot on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior official official said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police took Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot them in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there have also been protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ ames who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ der Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den is aiming to market an area of around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor is in question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner of Great Street , bought already a few months ago and the building was torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for a holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gr@@ asp@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends from the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
&quot; for months , this project has been in the discussion about ten to twelve million Euros . &quot;
&quot; intense reactions among sea bu@@ ds , which came to the meeting , highlighted the images and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come so that it pays off &quot; , &quot; said Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ungs . &quot;
&quot; because this was lacking , the development plans were even variable . &quot;

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign aimed at helping thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com , to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya from the war . &quot;
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
&quot; for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared with diabetes , diabetes completely only dissolved in one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose level that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are clu@@ es from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I of 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently in increasing attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
&quot; he demanded that , under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must reflect on long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , suggest@@ ing that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , the strong alcoholic and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control centre at the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four spra@@ yers from straw@@ berry sc@@ aff@@ ection@@ able dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was considered dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; ordinary &quot; &quot; teacher by explo@@ iting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; the police regarded the treas@@ ured plan as &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates were not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bored Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
you are talking about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ells things to turn around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with a five @-@ point advantage . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because it makes the players better . &quot;
standing now is so important .

&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the U@@ K@@ s , as the numbers of the Bureau of National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an ec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sp@@ lashes . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I voted . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , will see it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is false what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a report by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he reas@@ oned the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful , when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot;
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he pointed to Ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it came to the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations , and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I waited a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted head around , and I want my owners to think I am doing my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , M@@ oo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the coach have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly applied mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been like this last night .
it could have been like yesterday all the day .
but it was so on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver cur@@ sed arrest
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and driver cur@@ sed driver in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot;
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police came to Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged for driver cur@@ ses and under@@ las@@ si@@ ding assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against rivals because of claims on ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism at tac@@ kling his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a not@@ orious remark to the Storm Team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling .
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing about our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . however , over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . &quot;
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are p@@ auses , and do not have any points of tension ? &quot;
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm Team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bs with 200,000 $ deposit on drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who may have threatened a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to come to possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America to Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been from a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on a security deposit , under the conditions that he spends his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reporting to the police every day and keeps himself at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had stopped at a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment to the left as the police reported .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing crash tore apart completely .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept and got into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
&quot; she looked through , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; on 25 January this year , Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded not guilty to having received illegal pictures of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are caught off the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many fla@@ x@@ s were caused by fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the rural districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ables to the German side .
there they are received from the Federal Police and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at Munich &apos;s main station , according to federal police statements , more refugees arrived on Wednesday in comparison to the weekly beginning of Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8 am , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees had reached the city on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : runner from the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; tropical storm , which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , up to Thurs@@ days also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom of the sea with bows between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , above all , there is movement among the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August , according to the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , a lot of new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be sold to dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door versions . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA even on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra con@@ tender to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan de@@ posit@@ ors want to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s information with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger placed first hand on the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted a former in@@ mate of the Judi@@ cial Institute Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a solitary cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now back on the free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the constitutional judges lifted up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination there . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity injured .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons were decisive for the indem@@ n@@ ity only a few days of detention for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of dental damage .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; so they said in April a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell in the nude . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was taken over three months , between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons of Berlin have also come into head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to pun@@ ches it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the shortage of young people , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to the German Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Mr Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely with the un@@ common challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; according to various forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rent objects : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing estates are out of the rental price , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments each year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of Engineering agree that there must be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , a long @-@ term 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they will find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt there has been a political change : from prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence requirement that asylum seekers are confined to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the point of view is that refugees should be made possible more quickly to access the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that workplaces are most often conveyed by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the structure of networks is based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s view of the Royal Road to Employment Integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few married parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bags in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of the training - for example by allowing more vocational schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes on the lessons . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ utz from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ er or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance . &quot;
student willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally does not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because it does not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the board . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ authorized , from 1 January 2016 onwards this span shor@@ tens up to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state churches law into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him some control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to out@@ perform such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , at times , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency , and a general equality law for a decade . &quot;
&quot; however , it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for , and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years , if the country is to remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical services to the so @-@ called refugees , the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand out all newcom@@ ers at the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services rendered could be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to collect as many people with the limited performance catalogue , which the asylum application law provides . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpretation costs should be taken over , requires them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already helped many refugees with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors came from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as for the doctors , the refugees may even have a relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees even were physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to practise , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualification and possibly pass on examinations again . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong el@@ ong@@ ation and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new staging &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on a brick now invites to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ger and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of managers .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift for enthusiasts is therefore in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their everyday life and to take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger tip and jo@@ in@@ iness . &quot;
balancing the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the posture of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals we do not go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , are read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the top priority is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on its zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; for each visitor , there should be something like that . &quot;
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether 5 or 1 200 people , we always give our best and with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst starting from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , daily the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also vo@@ iced by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ phr@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , they had de@@ bu@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 working jobs
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will later divide into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; says the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on belief that closely focused companies can deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
&quot; Wen@@ ger insisted on Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that has not healed well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as few recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has reported 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 League games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 , which have the most injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign has started last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , judging by the judge scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from the past season with the champi@@ ons League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked out in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ ants among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common among men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask for help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with their emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life doubles the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can &apos;t really buy fortune . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of telephone counsel@@ ing , I said : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and risk @-@ threatening has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all the 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria is meeting in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only aiming at the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ h of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even though there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria during the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing lob@@ ster was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished past Johan Wil@@ and beautifully in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who proposed Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined with nine national players on the field and was hit with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ fu@@ sions and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was stab@@ bed in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after having used him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth install@@ ment after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last champi@@ ons League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion dollars through shares sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion from stock sales as part of its huge debt plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with declining commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores &apos;s share in trading on the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share jumped 2.7 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week &apos;s 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; in China , iron ore prices have declined by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confirming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner in this evening after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .

&quot; XI whose visit was first announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi respond to a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , FC Bayern was just a few years ahead of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times tro@@ phy winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion league , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was before the European Championship in 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and also the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann accepted the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this today is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .

&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in filming
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director always - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 lives and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to discri@@ minate discri@@ min@@ atory practices against farmers . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted the invitation , or already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and control help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which recently completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; to the final task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes ; it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received mass of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb within one half of the Houston branch for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word , which was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go all the way into the game . &quot;
&quot; the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ man hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escap@@ es the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall scored an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed st@@ ach comes from S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited at the beginning of the game from an even not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two internal ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I was wishing for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hai gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not beaten very well , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever Jus@@ tin A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four ropes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of an injury to the limbs .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to fight the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily suspended .
they shall then be transferred to other commun@@ es .
&quot; in the past ten days , according to the government @-@ presi@@ ding government responsible for the first time , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; collective throwing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup had passed by a military stake in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , sent back no refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new attempt to distribute more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ scored , those people who needed protection , also complain . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly parti@@ tioned in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; enormous effort of strength . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia in the night on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be secured with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking cre@@ denti@@ als over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants were on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
these include researchers from observations of the Raum@@ son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its path around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous solid body of cel@@ esti@@ al bodies , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; Cass@@ ini had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es at the southern pole of Saturn &apos;s South Pole in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; an investigation carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich lion , the diagnosis is probably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a united professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was also under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured herself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) during a violent clas@@ h at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur . &quot;
no fruit diet - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ go contains relatively much sugar - mainly su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who eats the fruits thus supports ten@@ si@@ veness , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel colour alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for the Christmas business in the United States , the U.S. parcel service U@@ PS again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be armed for the Christmas business . &quot;
in 2013 delayed deliveries had brought the pack@@ et services harsh criticism .
&quot; first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ado , then marked cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine side of the hair dryer , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair dryer partly blows with storm strength through the F@@ öh@@ nt@@ valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ western current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the mountain , on the night of Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the footh@@ ills with bends from 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adic@@ ally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair dryer can pi@@ erce through to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and in the mountains even or@@ cans of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , F@@ öhn ensures summer@@ y temperatures ranging from 23 to 27 degrees , humidity starts to st@@ ow on the slopes of the Alps . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter are expected to be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , following a large rainf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n comes out of the air , in consequence a cold front is rolling with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind is blowing strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures are significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the south . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday at the O@@ pp@@ io hill on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome near the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the consortium of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could live in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries as minority only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a ruined sin@@ ful ba@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then introduced the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus ( gil@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equal to &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles created are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar , and thus translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and one of the artist &apos;s words , who formulated his very personal thoughts to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane stock , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ work that , perhaps even to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to return art in a fast @-@ living time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterised today by advertisement , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall &quot; &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected mysterious themes for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th . &quot;
construction starts for BM@@ X railway
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model Earth &apos;s Hill for a round trip : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already finished . &quot;
&quot; par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ases in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to take the train . &quot;
&quot; so hills deported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval was received in October , the first church leader Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga places a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football responds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday , I am in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and would help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must pose the policy .
&quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals show a clear sign when they will be entitled to &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , head of sport Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee tragedy goes on everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use the Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our jet force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their places had started their own projects is great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , together with the German Federal Government , the association will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the German Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses eye in accident
&quot; according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out to the street - he told us this way last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner cited us . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you fall .

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus versus Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high stress of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his pedi@@ gree at the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal brothers Roman bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ mid@@ able statement by Mit@@ player R@@ eus , that the final one for the B@@ V@@ B must be the target for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl believes : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants leadership in Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility age &quot; at the IAA Commercial Vehic@@ le Show . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which will also come together with representatives of industry at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid change on digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; verify the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the German government wants to commit itself to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicle @-@ less vehicles on public roads will be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site appreci@@ ates the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German auto @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the request of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all to believe 31 percent at all . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in traffic 45 per cent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l tells team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title fight , the Düsseldorf Congress wants to only strike in the single individual at the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship session in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded me of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should focus on it , &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ ranking fifth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United made a serious injury to the right leg .
&quot; during the champi@@ ons League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a tac@@ kling by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he made men into skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past , it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the other hand because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit to death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly even op@@ a@@ que work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is a super@@ bly chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall work of art , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ inge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material have been spar@@ ed to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather trousers out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , delicate fashionable attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , but of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
Je@@ well@@ ery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long sti@@ ckers in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters . &quot;
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in a large quantity for customers who used them for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; this is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the sp@@ ouses . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ cide - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past stal@@ ks , represents an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not serve niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ on@@ ke P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken off . &quot;
private business and wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; exports are also weaker , current to Russia and the United States . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; for this year we have been introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ er@@ isches Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace embroi@@ dery .
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in some places , the machine stal@@ ks small chi@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ er gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by it : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old &quot; , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which plays the magic kid &apos;s girl for 20 years after the first film . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open itself wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; advancing new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , the promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to take up private capital , and over@@ haul the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that cannot be questioned for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a major role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to carry out their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury @-@ border value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus for@@ ge consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has received a corresponding work paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed along with full force of pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t at Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limits of the nerve @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , however , are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low @-@ stressed that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal that is highly enrich@@ ing over the food chain in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on his homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot;
mercury comes primarily through coal combustion to the environment .
&quot; according to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in river Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
