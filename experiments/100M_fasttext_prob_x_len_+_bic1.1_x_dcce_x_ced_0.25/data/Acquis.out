&quot; customs authorities take a charge of the loading of a road vehicle , a truck or a container in a transit center or on the way , so they have to point out the newly designed customs declarations and the type of checks carried out in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; customs declarations in other cases are viol@@ ated or damaged on the way in the 24 and 35 cases , or if goods are destroyed or damaged without violation of the tari@@ ff agreements and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R is included ; the internal regulations remain unaffected . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , where the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R does not use the net in the area of a contracting party , because easier procedures for customs clearance offer or the use of such a procedure is not required . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In such cases the customs authorities , where the TI@@ R transport is suspended or re @-@ recorded , shall be considered as a gateway at the exit or exit point at the entrance . &quot;
&quot; subject to the provisions of this Convention , in particular Article 18 , the originally specified customs office may be replaced by another destination . &quot;
&quot; upon arrival of the cargo at the destination customs office , the Car@@ net TI@@ R is in@@ competent to carry out , provided that the goods are supplied to another customs procedure or handled for free transport . &quot;

the customs duties of each contracting party recognise the customs declarations and / or contact details attached by the competent authorities of the other contracting parties .
&quot; however , you may also add customs declarations and / or wet@@ suits , but you will need to point out the net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in your country , on the corresponding regular sheets and on the sections that remain in the net TI@@ R , and mark the newly attached customs declarations and / or wet@@ suits . &quot;

&quot; II ) Inclu@@ des the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a separate nam@@ ing , so the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the Council shall discuss the refusal , after the Director General of the Organization - referred to as &quot; the General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization are actually able to fulfill them according to their conventions .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the Community and the States and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are under surveillance are as low as possible ;
II ) to ensure the protection of industrial secrets and to the inspec@@ tors of the organization for inform@@ ing sensitive information .
&quot; each State applies to the Organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials who fulfill the tasks of this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liber@@ als of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this agreement are terminated in terms of core material , if the community and the organization find that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the association noti@@ fies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention , the transfer of core material from the states which is subject to the safegu@@ ards under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated in relation to core material , as soon as the receiving state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re @-@ use of the securing measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association shall be agreed with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of the non @-@ use of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community shall ensure that the safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied only as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these hed@@ ging measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organisation will be held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or in the concerned states and on any passing on such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters , such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or an under secret protection of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the Community and the States bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , States or individuals who are subject to their sovereign power , but extraordinary costs due to a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs if it has been agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention , as applied to the nation@@ alities of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim made by the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or a state , with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Manager , the Council shall certi@@ fy that no core material , which must be subject to safety measures after this Convention , must be reimbur@@ sed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missi@@ les , so that it may also report the reports provided in Article X@@ II of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account the extent to which weight has been achieved by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is affected - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations will be held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore , that questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes relating to an establishment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a procedure adopted by the Council , any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be resolved upon the request of a party to submit an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth to presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the association or organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) When the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is capable of applying its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on the basis of one of the contracting parties about a change in this convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) Any changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all member states of the organization from any change in the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall come into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and states receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention shall be defined as necessary in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning preventive measures .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this agreement is the timely detection of det@@ ecting significant amounts of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a tur@@ no@@ ff by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity which is not proven for a specified period is specified below specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community of Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying their security measures , the Community of Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following methods and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more determined and appropriate in the supple@@ mental agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , processed , lost , lost or otherwise from the continu@@ ance of the core material and the quantity ; &quot;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a log and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in the stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
provisions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for the reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or stock @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material which is suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or will this core material or other , manufactured in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is subject to the safety measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the organization and the community shall consult each other on the application of suitable security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ recycl@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures following this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , if the total material material delivered in the states amounts to no more time at any time than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary to determine the extent necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organisation for this Convention , in the individual , as apply to the procedures set out in the Convention . &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or changed without change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; supple@@ menting agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all the efforts to make these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention into force ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report stated in Article 62 , the organisation establishes a consolidated directory of the entire core material underlying this agreement , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory list as a result of the following reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action plan set up at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entering into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has submitted a table from which it is apparent in which way it intends to apply the criteria set in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is set up a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; &quot; which the Member States shall contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; &quot; by the organization as an administrator , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is run separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest bonds of the member state , who are to pay in the currency of the state in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction , and to be deposited in the organisation of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contract within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contract on 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator assumes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school fees to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms without a discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each individual transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization , assessed , approved and managed by the organisation financed by ordinary means of the organization , with the purpose of the bi@@ dding process referred to in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special ac@@ tional account must not be used instead of ordinary funding from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same payment terms , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the Organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 50 years each . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
the amounts for the payment of this music box are to be paid directly to the organization that preserves them .
&quot; each individual transaction is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the funds is stated . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each individual transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or supplied ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and who may be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the loan granted at the time of the loan granted . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be rejected as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until the full assignment of all the special transaction loans , the administrator shall inform the EEC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors for review by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment for the promotion loan , the administrator informed the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ WG as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization with a detailed account of the external audi@@ tor &apos;s external audi@@ tor for this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC will soon report a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , resulting from the accounts payable and paid out of the account , are visible to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full issue of the promotion account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is due on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date that the EEC and the organisation may agree not to enter into force , so the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of the amount paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II paragraph 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the conclusion of the proceedings in question by the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ retariat further direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications with a notification regarding the proper authorization of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two signatures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with any wording being equally binding . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter exchange for the amendment of the An@@ nex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , the following FOR@@ AL@@ D@@ N@@ MENT is issued : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Nu@@ clear Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this programme comprises the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a Common European Company under Section V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; since extensive work is carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work that has reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable every contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work , i.e. the cost @-@ wise competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , to reach faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; every time the parties accept a new program , this will be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of each program .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement stipulated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those concluded between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on human resource exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the accession of the present agreement to the Common Companies J@@ ET , whose constitution accepts them . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom ensures that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose objective falls within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the Organ@@ iz@@ ations entrusted with the implementation of the association provided in Article 2 Cl@@ ause 1 of the present Agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement should include , in particular , the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group employed within the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to current or planned programs and activities in the field of Eur@@ atom , this task is true for all research and development activities that this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and targets their T * quality in the interests of both contracting parties to the common goal laid down in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives for consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Groups , which the VG research proposals submitted with regard to the fact that the funds granted to the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , are tru@@ thful with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme are optimally util@@ ised for all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the staff and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees employed within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which propose appropriate proposals to the Committee of Directors for the best possible use of resources , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in implementing the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a representative for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any affiliated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of the future programmes and the definition of its overall volume , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate Committee , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually on an amount which is at the detri@@ ment of the Eur@@ atom Programme at the cost of the Eur@@ atom Programme in the same relation as Switzerland &apos;s gross domestic product for the entire gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland has an amount equal to the Common Market J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association of this Common Market . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for funding the work within the context of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the Commission shares with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover expenses in the context of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year in question .
the Federal Council pays the Commission the amount due to this Article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are specified in App@@ endi@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of tari@@ ffs or other taxes , as well as import restrictions and restrictions , will be exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;

these liber@@ ations are not applicable to sal@@ aries and suffering that are paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge provided for the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are regulated in Articles 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Human Resources . &quot;
provisions on access to the knowledge applicable to the participation of Switzerland at the Common Companies J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Common Company .
the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an integral part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the affiliated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - appropriate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the affiliated third countries in the allocation of contracts for the implementation of the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and in the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be communicated to Switzerland and individuals or companies that can justify access to these knowledge , under the same conditions as the Member States , individuals or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
the knowledge gained during the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the affiliated third countries as well as the individuals or companies that operate in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or an affiliated third country research or production activities that justify access to these knowledge .
&quot; the contracting parties share this knowledge to other states , persons or companies only if there is an agreement between the parties , unless they are conducting research or production activities in Switzerland that justify the access to these knowledge . &quot;

I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot;
agreement in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of Member States &apos; claims in the medium term
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks apply a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor land , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with every stand@@ by credit , BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without exceeding five years altogether . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the opening of the loans as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would take account of the bank &apos;s assets , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; conditions would correspond to those that the BI@@ S applied at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds itself on the market , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks apply a corresponding application . &quot;

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I encourage the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export options for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the actual volume is not exceeding the agreed amount and carried out in accordance with the usual supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community occupies the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina are exceeding the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ ism rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; at the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the quantity prescribed under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; herein , the clause set by number 5 is taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 23@@ ,000 tons of slaughter body weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , so that the sale of intervention conditions in frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sale of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other support measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are interpreted in a manner consistent with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community , in turn , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the competent authority in charge of the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question cannot be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , the competent administrative authority of the competent authority of the Community will be informed in regular intervals the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; these details may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and operates smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including conditions , which are of importance to the target mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not referred to in the agreement . &quot;
the Committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the quantity , which is applicable from the entry into force of this agreement to the 1st January of the following year , is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to amendments that they consider necessary . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share with you the consent of your government .
I encourage you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb after the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb will not be com@@ promised in these markets , I am asking myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement New Zealand is safegu@@ ar@@ ded for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat of access to the community &apos;s market in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of his h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat are not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the actual volume of the annual amount is not exceeded . &quot;
the above listed quantities are carried out in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community affir@@ ms that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the community &apos;s market .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties shall consult each other before introducing such a change in clause 10 mentioned above in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community takes up the protective clause , it obli@@ ges itself to protect the interests of New Zealand that is em@@ itting itself from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ ism rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when new Member States are joined , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will change the amounts set in clause 2 corresponding to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Agreement ; herein , the clause 5 mentioned in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
the total quantity mentioned in clause 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of slaughter body weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , so that the sale of intervention conditions in frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , both parties undertake everything in order to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ hausen in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other support measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts stated in clause 2 in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
&quot; in its turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the designated authority by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods in question cannot be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , the competent administrative authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals is indicated in regular intervals the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; these details may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly examines the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market for both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions stated in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat are carried out under the agreement not referred to in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which shall be submitted to him by a contracting party and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contractual parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount paid by force of this agreement reached until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand as well as for the main area of New Zealand on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . &quot;
I encourage you to suggest that your government can agree to the foreg@@ o@@ ing that this letter and your response will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat . &quot;

C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
&quot; blood withdrawal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle by a closed , sterile tube system in which the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was incorporated before the steri@@ li@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood vessel , the bottle must be closed immediately and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution should not exceed 220 ml per liter of human blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration must not fall 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined beforehand on the hand of the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is determined by examining the blood cells at a new test of the don@@ or bl@@ uts .
&quot; in so far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these apply . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have yiel@@ ded the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , You and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged after this Convention shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .

&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate is either from the rest of the plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution that was added after plasma removal .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume is indicated on the label . &quot;
all processes required for production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the sealing must be carried out using a sterile and closed system and by pressure only .
&quot; if an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , the label must also indicate their volume and composition . &quot;
the human dry plasma is obtained through drying of the liquid which is deposited at the top in the case of centr@@ ing or sedi@@ mentation of human full bl@@ uts .
human dry plasma is obtained through cold drying or any other method by which den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity , which corresponds to the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not show visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) have identified a dangerous content of in@@ soles or immune hem@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ins are excluded .
&quot; if plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after bleeding , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , which show signs of bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of transfer of viral hepatitis , mixtures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods , are to be reduced in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out during plasma production , is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
a given amount of plasma is dissolved in the amount of water that corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from which it is made ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
&quot; II ) If a sufficient quantity of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de is sufficient , then coag@@ ulation is performed ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 ° C. &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mercury can not occur in the human dry plasma weight loss over 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is in a nitrogen @-@ ath@@ mosph@@ ere or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of storing any moisture ; it is to protect against light and keep at a temperature below 20 degrees . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions made of human plasma proteins are preparations made of the protein component comprising about 60 % of the total protein mass of the human body &apos;s plasma .
&quot; regardless of whether the final product is to be flu@@ ent or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container for 10 hours in order to activate the patho@@ gen of the viral hepatitis . &quot;
in preparations of human alb@@ um@@ in at least 95 % of the weight of the existing proteins alb@@ um@@ in must be alb@@ um@@ in .
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the Group is made from human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; comparison measurements of viscosity and clou@@ ding as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , which are made before and after heating on the solutions , may not result in a den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;
&quot; after heating on 57 C and six @-@ piece shaking in a mechanical shi@@ pper at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
I ) The fal@@ si@@ fication tests with specific anti@@ sera must show that only human plasma proteins are contained in both preparations ;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena cannot appear : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated twice in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um@@ di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is only calculated by volume of the flow of blood in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed through time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ stit@@ ter observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the Tit@@ er announces the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final blend in a series where a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the new standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ers contain 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of comparing the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be retained for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent , according to the label , lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents stated on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 g of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origins for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ori@@ zed or re @-@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents intended for international exchange for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
&quot; the quantity , which is in a container , must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued must be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to reinforce effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black printed label in English and French can be attached , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the fluid required for re @-@ dissolution , &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or label on the cardboard , in which the individual containers are located , or the utility instruction attached to the containers , contains the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 3 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the fluid required for re @-@ dissolution , &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention , each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be enclosed in accordance with the system for this protocol . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum activ@@ ates human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B . it ag@@ glut@@ inate no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ ser separately against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the serum should in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A2@@ B blood cells , so the same experiment is to be carried out with the once again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group B . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum activ@@ ates human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ ap@@ se against the in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed up on an object gir@@ der with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so that the same experiment with the back dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ ath@@ ic A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 , including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inate no human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ ath@@ ic A or B , i.e. those of group 0 . &quot;
it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells containing the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by group B blood don@@ ors ) .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ ser , separate from the floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ ap@@ se against the in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
the effectiveness of the serum should in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily identifiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
&quot; an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 per cent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , so it is necessary to perform ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double time that is necessary if the same attempts with the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity are performed . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed up to an object carrier with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so it is necessary to perform ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double time , which is necessary if the same experiment with the once again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5 - 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity may belong to one of two species that differ from the requirements under which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
&quot; with others referred to as &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved by presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are sw@@ amped in their own serum or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may change if international standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding par@@ ser to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells containing Do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are designed to use object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific for C @-@ an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are sw@@ amped in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ vitamin or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies have to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than with the ant@@ elop@@ es antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised through blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum activ@@ ates human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;

&quot; in the assignment , that this Convention shall not be interpreted in such a way that it bin@@ ds the parties of their obligations under other international agreements ; &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , and in particular , a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as classification paper ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) for all export and import procedures . &quot;
the convey@@ ances associated with the goods traffic between the contractual parties are provided by means of a classification paper to use for the im@@ print according to the samples in An@@ nex I to this Convention .
&quot; the classification paper serves as application or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out legally binding regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application is not guaranteed with sole use of the uniform Document ; &quot;
to be required by the participants in order for them to be eligible for the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief .
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the relevant goods are not present at a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; moreover , the submission of an incomplete application may be allowed . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) Any deviation from paragraph 1 , the application shall always be issued in one of the official languages of the export country , if they are carried out in this country by using others as the copies of the registration or col@@ lo@@ qui@@ al period . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the application copies required for each individual process section of a contract between the contracting parties , which may be added to the necessary copies required for the provision of the form@@ alities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the for@@ esters for export and the shipping method will be transferred to one and the same pre @-@ press by means of the copies intended for these for@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced , as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the application contained in the individual stages of the application shall coinci@@ de . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth distribution of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the un@@ covering of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be refused or rejected in whole or in part , if the sought @-@ after country of view is that the bai@@ li@@ ff would imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or inj@@ ure business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;

the contracting parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on establishing a Council for the Cooperation in the Area of Custom@@ s
&quot; it is desirable that , on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods will enter into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment , that without a change in Article 13 of the stated convention , the time of entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain uns@@ af@@ e - &quot;
&quot; article 13 of the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods , referred to in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , will receive the following form : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention shall come into force on January 1 , which follows immediately after the exp@@ iry of at least three months , to which at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or have deposited their rati@@ fication or accession documents , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;

&quot; a plant that is indispensable not only for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but which also allows the exploitation of land which does not allow any other planting , which makes the main part of today &apos;s production , favour@@ ably to any improvement in cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that from its cultivation will depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which are on its part entirely dependent on the measures taken to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ generating consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and olive oil are essential ingredients in the areas where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers of products ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that this causes all particular difficulties , which seriously damage the interests of producers and consumers and thre@@ aten the general policy of economic growth in the countries that lie in zones where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F the extraordinary meaning of the olive production for the economy of numerous countries , in particular the olive growing countries in the development ; &quot;
&quot; in view of DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that , in view of the particular conditions of olive growing and the market for olive products , measures must go beyond national borders and that international action is indispensable ; &quot;
in view of the 1956 International olive oil convention in its amended version as well as the 1963 International olive oil convention in its multiple extended and amended version and the International olive oil convention of 1979 ;
&quot; in DE@@ M BE@@ W@@ US@@ ST@@ SE@@ IN that it is essential to continue and develop the work begun within the framework of the agreed conventions , and that it is desirable to conclude a new agreement - &quot;

&quot; concerning the provisions of the resolutions 93 ( IV ) , 124 ( V ) and 155 ( VI ) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the following are : &quot;
( B ) maintaining proper working conditions in olive growing and in the olive industry in order to raise the standard of living in the population ;
&quot; to promote the co @-@ ordination of the production , industrial and market policy for olive oil , olive oil and table oli@@ ven and the market for these products ; &quot;
D ) to examine and facilitate the application of the necessary measures concerning the remaining products of the olive tree ;
&quot; III ) to reduce the production costs of the resulting products , in particular the olive oil , to improve the position of this oil on the overall market for cur@@ sed vegetable oils , &quot;
( IV ) to improve the situation of the olive industry in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Environment of Man in order to remedy possible har@@ ass@@ ment ;
&quot; ( a ) to facilitate the investigation and application of measures for the expansion of international trade with olive products to increase the means which the producers of products , in particular those in development , from their exports , increase and enable the acceleration of their economic growth and their social development taking into account the interests of consumers ; &quot;
B ) to take all measures that are suitable to extend the consumption of olive oil and olive oil ;
&quot; ( C ) to prevent any practice of unfair competition in international trade with olive oil , olive oil and tab@@ le@@ ware , and if necessary to fight the supply of goods - &quot;
&quot; improving market access and the reliability of supply , market structures and marketing , distribution and transportation systems ; &quot;
( e ) to undertake all activities and measures that are suitable to exhibit the biological value of the olive oil and the tab@@ le@@ ware ;
B ) to facilitate the investigation and application of measures for harmon@@ ising the legislation of the individual states which in particular refer to the marketing of olive oil and tab@@ le@@ ware ;
( II ) to prevent excessive fluctuations in prices that must remain at such a stand that they are fair and fair for the producers and appropriate for the consumer ;
&quot; create conditions under which production , consumption and international trade can expand harmon@@ i@@ ously , with the mutual connection between them to be taken into account ; &quot;
&quot; D ) to improve the information and consultation procedures in order to increase the transparency of the market for olive oil , olive oil and table olive oil . &quot;
&quot; from 1980 / 81 to 1983 / 84 a large amount of olive oil and table olive oil , converted into olive oil equivalent using a conversion cap of 20 by H. , produced when it was introduced in the calendar years 1981 to 1984 ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . den@@ otes the expression &quot; &quot; main export member &quot; &quot; a member that produced a smaller amount of olive oil and table oli@@ ven during the years 1980 / 81 to 1983 / 84 , converted into olive oil equivalent in the calendar years 1981 to 1984 , or during this period of economic year no such production was recorded ; &quot;
