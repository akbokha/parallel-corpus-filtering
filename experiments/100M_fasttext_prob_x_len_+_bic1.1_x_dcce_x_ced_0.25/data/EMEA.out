this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inhal@@ ing ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which patients alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal heart@@ beat ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in case of both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole beha@@ ves like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but at a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is able to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s efficacy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , over twelve weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder resulting from increased un@@ rest with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was investigated . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs the solution to the intake .
&quot; in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than placebo . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients , and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , pal@@ pation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess , nausea , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes were in the case of bi@@ polar @-@ I disturbances , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s treatment against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I failure , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day irrespective of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ign form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if patients with Abi@@ li@@ fy treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a m@@ ns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study of fixed dos@@ ages , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents which allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with respect to a deterioration in glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central potent drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the Dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or to plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns generated in the animal reproductive studies in animal reproductive studies , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms .
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of respon@@ der patients who taught a response to the study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ A@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was significantly reduced by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ ta@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some over 2 weeks were not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapy serum therapy , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ regulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the mean removal time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , with extensive metabol@@ isation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as with a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were found to be far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day irrespective of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases following the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;

&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the mid @-@ level Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical stage . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ ta@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy volunteers , the ratio of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 . in addition a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status given to the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection in patients with ap@@ athy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ated and mal@@ ign form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ gregation was greater compared to the one single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the Dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ gregation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s sole gift . &quot;
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of ast@@ er@@ iness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders linked to placebo and was similar to semi @-@ oper@@ i@@ do@@ cs .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ap@@ athy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms with regard to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ dity , a similar activity was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a decreased number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the proportion of respon@@ der patients who taught a response to the study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions @-@ Sc@@ ale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ ta@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was observed , a gain increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum therapy , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until the maximum plasma level was reached from 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no immediate toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15 and 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were based on mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; rab@@ bits were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole application or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if only patients treated for the first time were treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in relation to efficacy indicators such as time to the worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who previously had other treatments in their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit for Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to authori@@ ze Abra@@ x@@ ane &apos;s transport services throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in sensory Neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached in degree 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data to recommend dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data regarding safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ron number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac in@@ cases in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ pation remedies . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should employ a reliable contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child to witness . &quot;
&quot; prior to treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm preservation , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important cases of adverse events performed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in blood heart disease : &quot;

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the composition of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel due to end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ ls@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III trial .
&quot; in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma . &quot;
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ axel in patients with pac@@ lit@@ axel in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 250 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line Therapy , are outlined below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared with pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one grade for patients who , at a time during the therapy , experienced an peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 . &quot;
the natural progression of peripheral Neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or tissue attachment of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 17@@ mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ic ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data were available to patients over the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in light of light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorization will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail mort@@ g@@ ages with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing advice . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood glaci@@ al values , in which a blood @-@ blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected before the procedure . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ di@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
&quot; in patients suffering from kidney problems and in patients who want to have an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients suffering from kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables them to create epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicine . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of secre@@ ted under the skin have been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , cre@@ eping mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that according to the European Union regulations , the medicine has proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces stre@@ amed pati@@ os will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ee P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the onset of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions , which require a large volume of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;

&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is necessary . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bic target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the stre@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to ins@@ ure the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) in the treatment should not receive an Ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous ro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ etic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ rots or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ; in patients with recently admitted heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the refrac@@ tive cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fol@@ dable or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on the immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in . &quot;
clinical trials have observed an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies did not show any significant benefits due to the application of epo@@ et@@ ins if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms and prevent blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients under chemotherapy should be taken into account a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa gene and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; if the h@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should have adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is not possible to exclude that an elevated risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can occur for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial mo@@ b value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven that they improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy reduced when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 to 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to control the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and adjust the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosage to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
&quot; in vitro studies of tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ils , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ li@@ osis . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood supply . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and , in terms of amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients . &quot;
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumor progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival among patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than with the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and an extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

&quot; prior to the market launch and in agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner has to supply medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system listed in version 3.0 and in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application is set up and functional , before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine applied in traffic is applied . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in the case of obtaining new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures , • by request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • In a month before your treatment , you suffered a heart attack or stroke - if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , if you have already encountered such a drop of blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial con@@ ges@@ tion ) or the brain ( vascular disorder of the car@@ rots ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered from a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests if necessary so as to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , de@@ composition of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the beginning of therapy . &quot;
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ retro@@ active ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value can cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , treatment of blood poverty with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for the evaluation of the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your physician will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may affect the tumor neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer an orthop@@ edic surgery , Ab@@ se@@ amed should investigate and treat the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply or apply other medicines , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may associate certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood ar@@ tery ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed over two equal large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary to check the treatment success and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time prior to surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of intervention and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ ir@@ t yourself under the skin Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones jump ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as the h@@ are ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the disease , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) was norm@@ alized in the blood by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; in the study of older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared with the patients . &quot;
&quot; compared with all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta adverse events occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta manufactures clari@@ fication material for physicians to prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

&quot; treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get provide adequate calcium , accordingly two times a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorders ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger ones . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data for safety and efficacy are missing .
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before beginning treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid introduction of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly two times a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental treatment , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was comparable between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the most common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction ( Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid ) was associated with kidney function disorders , which were related to the decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced kidney function were in a clinical trial for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cla@@ ir and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , rose in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local responses After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local responses to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been successfully treated , especially for cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction and other dental procedures . &quot;
&quot; 7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area near a patient with A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the event of over@@ dose associated with clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compensated . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of cereb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip at 6.0 % , the shaft neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken out of the tank one year after the third annual dose . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture in patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
&quot; bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of time during study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta Treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment performed over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total frac@@ tures and 4.3 % on the sh@@ ear@@ ing neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at regarding the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was investigated in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed disease ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and influence of pain was observed after 6 months in comparison with the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
&quot; patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to the therapy ) , could be included in an observation phase . &quot;
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma cruci@@ ble rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β @-@ 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination of time t ½ γ 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body clear@@ ances amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion times of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
&quot; because of severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C ) were given six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 72 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use of accumulated exposure , which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced due to low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Requi@@ rements of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , supplements the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1 8.1 of the application application , and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk management plan The holder of authorization for the placing on the market under@@ takes to conduct the studies and additional activities related to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application and all subsequent versions of the CH@@ MP approved version of the R@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease patho@@ gen Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , which is known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with foods and beverages , you are concerned that you should take enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year given by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; as A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood in the time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can operate more than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before you complete the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta if you consider ending treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs of low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse events adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this utility information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta has to be performed two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or respectively which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on setting the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete list of adverse events related to A@@ comp@@ lia was found in the package supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can intensi@@ fy the risk of depression and , among other things , cause a small minority of patients to su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( drug against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

he added a diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data for effectiveness and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported to up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who , apart from obesity , do not have any apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other nearby persons can point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice , if these symptoms occur . &quot;
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than corresponding Plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 % , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; only slight symptoms were observed in a case study , in which a limited number of people were given disposable income of up to 300 mg . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year for A@@ comp@@ lia was 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo . &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .

&quot; 5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data for safety and consequ@@ ent adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin is to be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , thus allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in triple therapy was investigated ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; the study measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg when using dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional application of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ure@@ a showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used in patients with increased initial liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease .
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach ache , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , liver enzyme values can be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are fores@@ een .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected which can ag@@ itate of fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduced by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ op@@ r@@ its ( relative reduced by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral bi@@ polar or triple combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ s , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients talk about disturbances of visual acuity ; appropriate ophthal@@ mic clari@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or she enters , the treatment is to be dismissed ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker , and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are dimin@@ ished , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the index of refra@@ ction , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents over three times the upper limit of the normal range were equally common to placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa drugs . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported on cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ more in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was sur@@ passed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ a compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was evaluated in a small study at 18 weeks of type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slight increase in LD@@ L cholesterol have been observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced overall plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both through an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to efficacy is roughly three times the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies have demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the put@@ ty ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma elimination lifetime of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; in patients with reduced kidney function , the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearing of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia , and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are dimin@@ ished , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the familiar aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans resulted in an increased incidence of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide . &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ves was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both through an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was lacking in terms of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients received with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medi@@ cation , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both through an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list can be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ law@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar level has significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin of animal origin ) can lead to a change in dosage required . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin have reported that the early symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however be developed in stages : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the entire working time is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption agent lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

&quot; the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; checking a set dose • Take the number on the cap right next to the metering stamp • add the highest number you can see on the button • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , insulin is dischar@@ ged from the injection needle and the adjusted dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly attempted to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps : &quot;
then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering stamp is over .
make sure to press the button only during injection . • Ke@@ ep down the button after the injection completely until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
&quot; if not , turn the closing cap until the push button is fully pressed and then proceed as described in before use • P@@ ossi@@ bly , you can hear a cli@@ ck@@ able noise when pressing the button . &quot;
you may not set a dose which is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual volume scale to estimate how much insulin remains .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin released . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already seen signs of de@@ formation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out k@@ not ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; , &quot; which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients take more medicines for prevention of g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood at the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took the aden@@ ur@@ ic dose of 80 mg once a day and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl of the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients suffering from heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available gyp@@ sum no@@ des and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
&quot; if the acid content level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; as there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In case of isch@@ em@@ atic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing drugs , a acute g@@ out attack can occur during the course of treatment , because by lowering the serum sample cone , urine acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases rises so far that it is a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and further course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ ara did not perform any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhi@@ bitions can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ spi@@ ke ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects associated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen were associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) daily . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without the need for a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x applied a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ s down the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant changes in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be close to side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful while controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or exercising hazardous activities until they can reasonably be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect its performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ et in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 episodes per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ ic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the history of the sick .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that were reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short inhal@@ ation , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
the active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of Pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the Re@@ action sk@@ in@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → U@@ ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study ) conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum pole levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the start of study of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering of the serum sample cone to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained continuously throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration in patients regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in the Phase 3 extension study showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 did not require treatment against a g@@ out dose ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a p@@ ush@@ stroke ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in g@@ out node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients with a complete disappearance of the g@@ out lymp@@ h no@@ des up to 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by dosing simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after the intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration in the serum , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool was found as unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ y / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ y of the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( child @-@ pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
&quot; age There were no significant changes in the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites , after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects . &quot;
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , at about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a decrease in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 4,@@ 3 times and with bearing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without the need for a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Off@@ ers long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to make sure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , is ready before the drug is brought into circulation , and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP guidelines , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human drugs with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is necessary • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of the crystals will be prevented and thus a reduction of the ail@@ ments will be achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or suffer or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated for a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han Syn@@ drome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cl@@ ung before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if you need to prevent a sei@@ zure or treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply or apply other medicines , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using / apply any of the following substances because interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C can occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to serve machines .
please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consulting your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , patients with low vitamin D levels were lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also provided data to show that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is required to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive organs such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , tri@@ mmed abdom@@ en , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en , as well as su@@ cked up . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in case of diseases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; pep@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that may indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to remove the medicine after symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active heart@@ burn or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 . the risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be elevated in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , suffered from stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a ( after market launch ) , including some serious and associated complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly containing intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ otherapy treatment in patients needing a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned for the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before beginning therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applied during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that detect embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
&quot; o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but it has also been reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III trials , the middle asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the trough . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and trough continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new fluid frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption of a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg following noc@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before recording a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread to the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radioactive @-@ marked substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is still to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in time , more studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been carried out and investigated , as Ad@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , elevated blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) versus tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , adv@@ ann@@ on may not be applied . &quot;
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph because the Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsule , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; norm@@ alities of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus models should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ts . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ m are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days before Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application In order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated . &quot;
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance Therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The or@@ ale Adv@@ ance Therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance Do a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ances , this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph once a day the treatment must begin with the oral initial dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients , which are converted to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph in lung , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood frac@@ tures in the targeted area a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ance In switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ m controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ m during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy or at the same time using substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the cereb@@ ral mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood usually lie in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sions or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; norm@@ alities of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is yet available . &quot;
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph .
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to de@@ composition of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies may be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors under such circumstances can be subject to considerable variations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was seen as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called aqu@@ eous humor , or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , which can therefore also occur under adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , over@@ loading and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f are included , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose included , special care is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels at the same time as substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effects on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone level , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions are taken about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially decrease the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus as compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effectiveness profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; most common ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( estimated on the basis of available data ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , is frequently increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with adv@@ an@@ agra@@ ph .
&quot; it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ m , including EB@@ V , lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; effective mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ aling path@@ ways in the T cell and thereby prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed acute out@@ casts occurred within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ance Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % , and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ ances and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ ance Arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ ances and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ ances and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ ance Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f Arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ ances was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference of treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ ance Rate interval &#91; -@@ 9,@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ ances vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ ance Arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; released results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and colon transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; 175 patient @-@ transplan@@ t patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the major studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was ob@@ liter@@ ated by 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no gra@@ ft rejection was observed was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ t patient of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower . &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients receiving a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised procedure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( via protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the as@@ pi@@ red level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml per 5 .
&quot; colon transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ ching aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , leading to Tal@@ mirrors between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann @-@ Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place over the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ m during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ations are used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought in to enable the formation of the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to a drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under 6 years , the application of the drug was examined for preventing ble@@ ed@@ ings and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ances was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood cells with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued approval for the transport of lawyers from the European Union to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II @-@ deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the ensu@@ ing hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period is not to sink below the indicated plasma cruci@@ ble ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients below 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment course , adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
individual patients can differentiate in their response to factor VI@@ II in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosage speed should depend on the patient &apos;s desire , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk is the largest within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ n@@ estic inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ dose ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the most common AD@@ R@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed by a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion ( 10 @-@ 14 postoperative day ) .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - and the clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( ≥ 150 days ) in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) .
&quot; in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate H@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; previously untreated patients of a current clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated protein was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pren@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since initial approval , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes filing P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited submitted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for the transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues which connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and can not cause infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the original documents submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in Inj@@ ection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i has advantages for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not assume that the CH@@ MP has consequences for patients participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
changed ingredient release means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced back to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n on their own . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart @-@ hunting ) , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , including adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dosis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of aer@@ os@@ ols across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without crushed , broken or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of absence due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fade .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , ur@@ got@@ amine , can@@ ni@@ y@@ dro@@ ge@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to the execution of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions and reduce it to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ ols during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , have no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a presum@@ ption that can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ ea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ arian procedures . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart@@ beat , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ eria , ten@@ derness , hyper@@ tension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no impact on standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s between 12 and 78 years , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the plasma &apos;s administration . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine has been bio@@ equivalent to the application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet after the single application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
&quot; however , based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could not detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of lau@@ rel / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not ter@@ ato@@ genic . &quot;
&quot; the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1 8.1 of the application application is established and works , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if , under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , the following symptoms or diseases may occur or are diagnosed : • hyper@@ tension • Hear@@ ing heart rhythm , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or strengthening existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or de@@ grade the attention . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash have been reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleeping disorders , muscle pain , cra@@ mps , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver symptoms , was also very rarely reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies of about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by modi@@ fying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inhal@@ ing and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom@@ scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited clinical trial experience for the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of the allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression , and may be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed . &quot;
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy @-@ free time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases , which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dried ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nin@@ ef@@ old clinical dose ) .
&quot; this includes in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no impact on standard measurement variables of flight gli@@ ding , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing of eyes and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
&quot; persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall score for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as representative of further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms despite e@@ ti@@ ology and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine deficiency is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary disease , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in the case of chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant pain after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out . &quot;
in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) were not based on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , with a comparable degree of exposure to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ cordless , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years of age ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in a limited way , is identical to that of children who are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup Group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy were given a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dosage of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) was used over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was apparent . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing of eyes and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall score for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ semination of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that have limited metabolism .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out . &quot;

&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ats must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( ninet@@ een clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs , and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses , which has been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no impact on standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing of eyes and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall score for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

there is limited clinical trial experience for the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of side @-@ effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in the case of an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no impact on standard measured values of flight gli@@ ding , including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ised phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose Cros@@ sover studies conducted by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose study studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
&quot; food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x by A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , whereas food T@@ max of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extended from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;

in single dose Cros@@ sover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ ate for taking in were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of the prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical ir@@ ri@@ zation tests for the melt tablet revealed that this formulation represents an impro@@ b@@ able risk of local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in a limited way , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency may not take this medicine . &quot;

&quot; infants between 6 and 23 months were the most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution had no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be present in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall score for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ semination of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution for taking the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n contains , no biological valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; influenza pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new stem of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from humans to humans , because people have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to make antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) was puri@@ fied and used as a part of the vaccine . &quot;
a study of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , am@@ er@@ ase is available as a solution for inhal@@ ing , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should first be prescribed if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily that together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
&quot; for children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of am@@ er@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , but can delay damage to the immune system and therefore also the development of infections associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was enhanced with low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors by 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study of adults treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of am@@ er@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; am@@ er@@ ase must also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like as@@ gener@@ a and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take am@@ er@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; gener@@ alism is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefits of am@@ er@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have not been proven in patients who have previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit to transport am@@ er@@ ase in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
usually am@@ er@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boost of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ er@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been studied in children . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ alism is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
am@@ er@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 iso@@ cy@@ te 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ er@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with am@@ er@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually am@@ er@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of am@@ er@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ id , which can be metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ er@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ cos@@ ine content of the A@@ Gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
am@@ er@@ ase should be dis@@ car@@ ded for a period of 5 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ ti@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ amm@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medi@@ ums with a low therapeutic width should not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 iso@@ cy@@ te 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines whose active substances are mainly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to compensate the reduced plasma rate by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
&quot; St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) . &quot;
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ using mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % reduced if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg once daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given but a tight surveillance is recommended because the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use am@@ er@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ tic component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and am@@ er@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cruci@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ er@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase of C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , among them also substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may result in interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions related to these drugs when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma cruci@@ ble of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the con@@ current gift of am@@ er@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ litis , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in the plasma cruci@@ ble are to be expected at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended until stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time A@@ gener@@ ase is advised with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma pi@@ per in 3 to 4 cases .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation how to adjust the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus dosage if am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as am@@ er@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk la@@ k@@ eting rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exceeds the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight was demonstrated during the down@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not impaired by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early onset and rarely lead to treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fet@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ er@@ acken ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine , only one case was observed ( Sti@@ er@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin rash usually were mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; cases of o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed at the sign of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhi@@ bitions of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F / F / F / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / V / F / F / F / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / V / F / F / V / V / F / F / F / F / V / V / F / F / F / F / V / V / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / V / V / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / S / F / F / F / F / F / S / S / S / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M
&quot; conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
the phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients , in which an Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and one of them appear to cause a limited resistance against an@@ ta@@ z@@ an@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; in reverse , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against several other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of am@@ er@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with one PI , predominantly made with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to am@@ er@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the time @-@ ad@@ missible average change of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ inf@@ low threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of untreated am@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; the studies included as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; am@@ er@@ ase should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) amounts to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration at Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion , probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time as am@@ er@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were used in dos@@ ages which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic use , there was little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of am@@ er@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality in both the animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure below therapeutic doses lay in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or slight h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
am@@ er@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given but a tight surveillance is recommended because the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed at the sign of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; in reverse , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against several other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; am@@ er@@ ase should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time as am@@ er@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were used in dos@@ ages which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

studies on the toxic@@ ity of juven@@ iles treated at the age of 4 showed a high mortality in both the animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that the metabolism processes in juven@@ iles are not yet fully developed , so that am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution for inhal@@ ing is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefits of c@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not documented neither in patients treated with PI nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for am@@ er@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing and low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination among these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adap@@ tion for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of am@@ er@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ generic term solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that am@@ er@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with am@@ er@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .

important information about certain other components of am@@ er@@ ase solution to take out The solution to intake contains Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col which can lead in high doses to side effects .
&quot; Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including cra@@ mps , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase must not be taken , special caution when taking A@@ gener@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the intake of am@@ er@@ ase , take it as soon as you remember it , and continue taking the intake as previously . &quot;
&quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sickness , vom@@ iting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally , the rash may be of serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat intake on the stomach and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat sweeping in the neck ( &quot; &quot; Sti@@ er@@ acken &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ ih@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is performed three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks pause between treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo had been carried out either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions limit efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème is continuing to continue until all visible gra@@ dients have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ine@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up study 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should begin ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can be applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rep@@ ul@@ sion or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , where no daily preparation was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a fall were observed with circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ tur . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher doses than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
no clinical experience has been given to the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ ane@@ ously applied means for the treatment of out@@ patients in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal area .
&quot; limited data may indicate an increased rate of elevation reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the elimination of cow@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach has not been studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or reactions are after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and untreated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , so the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tumours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this use , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 acts of les@@ ions have reduced overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) cannot be obtained after a single application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly shared and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local responses to the place of treatment of cow@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most frequently reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects .
&quot; the most common adverse event , as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week @-@ weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the clinical signs assessed according to the test chart shows that in these studies , with five @-@ times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and to severe scar@@ ring and shor@@ tening ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the unique oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the gra@@ p@@ ples in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of the patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who received placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
total healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ phase treatment per week was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this could remain for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne les@@ ions within a cohesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications for outward F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively ) . &quot;
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for the mice also yiel@@ ded no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with the mal@@ administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being due to systemic exposure is considered very low . &quot;
tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream before and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
&quot; it can harm other people even if these are the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( gen@@ itals ) and anus ( after ) ● superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently occurring , slowly growing shape of the skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to solar radiation during their previous lives .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial Bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with ac@@ up@@ war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; O If you have previously applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor before you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin responds to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue spot faster , or cause fatigue . &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , it is easier skin reactions which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes at the application site ( wound secre@@ tions , inflammation , swelling , skin decay , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

&quot; the study focused mainly on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion body . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase , or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will examine all new information that may be known , and where necessary to update this summary . &quot;
the makers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to authori@@ ze the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which rehabilitation centres for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time using Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data in new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to breast milk compared to the mother &apos;s milk is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not silent . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly referred to as in@@ fusion reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 or over , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditioned participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s un@@ desirable drug effects related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version occurred within 3 months from the start of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 with a severe form of trial usually came to a Serbian trial ( on the average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) , there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom there was never a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lacking until low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effects on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that did not appear to interfere with the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasoning for the enzyme replacement therapy is in a sufficient restoration of enzyme activity sufficient for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating substrate and the prevention of further accumulation .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ic @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of treatment , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the capacity of the placebo group , which is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ at@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study had a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG level was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients treated by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variables ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed . &quot;
an open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a normal mental development rate ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe form of progression only limited or no progress in cognitive development had to be observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on G@@ AG levels in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique application , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; as no case studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except for those listed under 6.@@ 6. &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the marketing authorization has completed the following study programme , whose results are the basis for the annual review report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will cover long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are using drugs that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Skin rash • Skin rash , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Illumin@@ ated pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the package contents will be updated . &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient at first the number of th@@ inner bottles to be dil@@ uted .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer alone ) and &quot; &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily on other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small &quot; &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens as sole treatment . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ TA is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid lack ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose can be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; in a major study , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local progressive or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ TA was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta were longer survival times than with the comparison drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ in , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as after each third stop @-@ treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be created before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ tier 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose induc@@ tions an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies did not show that patients aged 65 years or above have an increased side effect risk compared to patients aged 65 years .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data regarding safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
&quot; the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients with a reduced liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied in particular in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of bone immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ron number has again reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ te number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ invasive toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
all patients for whom treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; many patients with whom these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the out@@ flow will be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible expansion of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , males should be advised before the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding the sperm preservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when used in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; use i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for pregnant women , but , as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , males should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed over@@ goes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; frequency indications : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontan@@ eity ) . &quot;

cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs were reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ dable and acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) .
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ otic patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ura . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was demonstrated in the application of the Lun@@ - gen@@ cancer symptom@@ dial in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ ess arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a di@@ lu@@ sion of the lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was found in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0,@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology to survival revealed clin@@ ically relevant sub@@ categories according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = mean @-@ to @-@ treat ; IT@@ T = Contin@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a Statisti@@ cal Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ level limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ cy@@ te transfers ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , patients sel@@ ectively needed ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed according to the application as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose are found in urine only 24 hours after application . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

&quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body measure index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and do not have any weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are ham@@ pered , they cannot break down some fats in the food , thereby causing around a quarter of the fats that are fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study of all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could not be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with hat@@ ching , stu@@ d@@ led cord , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stool , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not sufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a light hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to minimal absorption , the dosage is not necessary for older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; because weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the anti@@ diabe@@ tic dosage needs to be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
&quot; patients , who are all@@ i as well as drugs against hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted . &quot;
it is recommended to take additional pregnant women to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in a study on drug interactions , as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a decrease of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma cruci@@ ble was observed . &quot;
&quot; when using War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the application of a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal overweight and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose by or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid back @-@ up of possible systemic effects can be traced back to the inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , has blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average total cholesterol level with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average rate of LD@@ L cholesterol in or@@ list@@ at is 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo -@@ 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general in the case of therapeutic dos@@ ages not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ tone ring ) and M3 ( M1 for split of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 years with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or more . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height or overweight .
&quot; even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for a check up . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose as part of a diet , you can lose one extra kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , severe rheumato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood @-@ th@@ inning effect . &quot;
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral interventions for contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or removed if you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
&quot; before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat heart rhythm disorders . • App@@ ly A@@ carb@@ ons for the treatment of diabetes . &quot;
&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take any medicine against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the blue pages in paragraph 6 , see Other helpful information on how to define your cal@@ orie and fet@@ al limits . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , risk food@@ borne illnesses ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; nutritional supplements are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your eating habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
feed fat to decrease the likel@@ ihood of food@@ borne illnesses ( see section 4 ) . try to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active while taking and after taking all@@ i .
&quot; • If you cannot find any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet and returning to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take one capsule . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
the most common side effects are combined with the mode of action of the capsules and arise because fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , because at this time you may not have consistently reduced fat content in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ in several days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally consume . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;
• Do not store medicines for children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the box . • The container must hold tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow them . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is attached to this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • stroke • Cer@@ eal cancer • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the onset of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake is how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the following tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; to find out which quantity is suitable for you , refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories you choose . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional benefits . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you walk daily only little or at all , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you walk daily 150 k@@ cal , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30 @-@ 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutrition journal containing information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty tissue and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional application of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ inflammatory agent ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong respectively moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; in chemotherapy , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the distribution of Alo@@ xi in the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in case of moderate @-@ L@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the large bow@@ el disease , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with the simultaneous offering of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not used to prevent nor treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was not inhibit@@ ing the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral metast@@ asis , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ational pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least in connection with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ st@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reviews . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ oh@@ oxi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate @-@ L@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C 0@@ - ∞ ) generally are dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range from 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; according to the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a single intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabol@@ isation C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; following a unique intraven@@ ous bolt injection in healthy patients , the total body exposure amounted to 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ances 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination of the terminal and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions which are considered to be sufficiently over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the promotional potential . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is intended for unique application , the relevance of these results is very low . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this authorization for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the drug approved for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug as an effective ingredient already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue detects damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino acid ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are hei@@ gh@@ tened . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data indicating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was done ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes provided the E@@ MEA is endor@@ sed .
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease increased again in more patients than in the case of reference medicines ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ aries ( crack or inc@@ ision ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ t Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not be effective against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years , the area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo had responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home patients , about 90 % of the patients in both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( freezing cavi@@ ties in the body &apos;s tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh in the short term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of alt@@ ar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can begin . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary open wounds the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Accor@@ ding to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after topical application of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in regards to a statement on effects on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
the decision whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to be weighed between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the destination that concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking P @-@ binding inter@@ ferences and prevents the normal formation of active 50s of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , should a consultation be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of non @-@ contact to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us treatment , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children from 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans according to topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats sign of reduced fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ewed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected . &quot;

&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless you expressly have been prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is made from visible on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if ail@@ ments occur . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination schedule consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed by two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ et , which has been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination of twin children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ X children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination schedule consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ et adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ X adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix had a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the vacc@@ ination schedule for the pri@@ ori@@ zation with ambi@@ ance consists of two doses . the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
&quot; if a vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ination is requested for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully ensured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in cases of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system , so that in these cases the application of additional vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously , as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ ine and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 V@@ acc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation based on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the test persons who had given the Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test persons who received the Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses schedule .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vaccine , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , serum concentration rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serv@@ os conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ inated compound than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the complete vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month @-@ vacc@@ ination .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies comparable to 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month @-@ vacc@@ ination regi@@ men is compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year at the same time as a combination of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the current formulation as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resor@@ ption on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as swimming in water contaminated by wastewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not be fully protected from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those for hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you would like to have a fast protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of an infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; if you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medications ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been given or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / has or is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , there should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , ambi@@ ance is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , except it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) at your child .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; ♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ al doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches , lack of appetite &quot;
&quot; ♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ al doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • A fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Under@@ tak@@ ings , gastro@@ intestinal ail@@ ments &quot;
&quot; further side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 injured cans ) were reported , are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended failures , which can be it@@ chy or infl@@ ated , swelling of the eye contours and the face , causing breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ ance remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix has been put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients with a complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - split up to several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered by a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; this was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a fake medicine , i.e. without active agent ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant odo@@ urs or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information was available for this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme shortage already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the application if there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg , as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ sili@@ co@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as in with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal proliferation slow@@ ed and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate cell , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
&quot; however , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease led itself to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born infants at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients , there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ path@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; following an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; according to various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable by a majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cy@@ c@@ lic disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies . &quot;
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) were five times higher than after the first gifts with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat did not have any indic@@ ative effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg , as well as for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ sili@@ co@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds of the cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate cell , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; based on studies on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ulate form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to obtain the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you undergo laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , follow @-@ up of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturbances and a worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical states have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you are aware of any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , uncomfortable skin odor , skin rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this utility information .
&quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the &quot; &quot; App@@ ly up &quot; &quot; date on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; App@@ ly up &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS look and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same single doses or through a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
• Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Place a straight edge such as a knife bridge over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess pel@@ let . • Dis@@ cover the recommended amount of measuring sco@@ op gran@@ ules from the container .
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single application or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients frequently use a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI administration - was just as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the placing of angi@@ ox in the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a further PCI is carried out in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a clearance of 0,5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to below 225 seconds , a second bolt will be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose is administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al function ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT again to test after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ validation ru@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In case of severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Fam@@ ous hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding caused by mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • Sever@@ al un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis .
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur at arter@@ ial point points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle throughout ble@@ ed@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din is back to the level prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of Bi@@ validation ru@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et units or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and for patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings performed significantly less than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ validation dru@@ id plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in or bleeding in the point area , reducing hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ al@@ isations which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and for patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after extensive application and are grouped according to system classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din is to be removed immediately and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or to cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; binding of Bi@@ validation ru@@ din on th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is now re@@ taining the binding of Bi@@ validation ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din with serum for patients , in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , did not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ validation ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients who received aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind trial with more than 6,000 patients undergoing one PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 . &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients delivered limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ veri@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin Mol@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working time than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two trials involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in Type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was diagnosed after six months versus a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin pumps . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin sensitivity , or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active ingredient , the mark ( her@@ - plate ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or treatment of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ enes , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ enes and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics , such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and Reser@@ pin , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c equivalent regulation can be allevi@@ ated or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin allergy occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral health . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the un@@ desirable compounds known from clinical trials , grouped according to system organ@@ categories and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; in@@ estim@@ able ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , headache , nausea , and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be neglected to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a physician . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ co@@ lic injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin sensitivity , the effect occurs faster and the working time is shorter than for cou@@ gh@@ y normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin Mol@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that a comparable post@@ pran@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; when insulin was removed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control than with human insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was reached . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal commen@@ ces , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ an@@ uts before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin dosage in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal compared to human insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before a meal ( figure 1A ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin dosage in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
