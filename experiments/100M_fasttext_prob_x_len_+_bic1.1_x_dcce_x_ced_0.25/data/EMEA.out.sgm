<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inhaling (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental illness, in which patients alternate manic episodes (periods of abnormal heartbeat) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in case of both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole behaves like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but at a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole is able to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abilify's efficacy to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, over twelve weeks, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder resulting from increased unrest with the treatment of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was investigated."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs the solution to the intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients, and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), palpation (drowsiness), drowsiness, nausea, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes were in the case of bipolar-I disturbances, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke to Aripiprazole's treatment against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I failure, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day irrespective of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the appearance of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazzol (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension) or hypertension (including celeriated and malign form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occur during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients with Abilify treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosages, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents which allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with respect to a deterioration in glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central potent drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'poor' ('poor') metabolisers, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the Dosing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphian / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphian)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or to plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns generated in the animal reproductive studies in animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned not to use dangerous machines, including vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total of reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-operidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy include malign neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in the application of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the caudatus and the putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo in three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 was the proportion of responder patients who taught a response to the study medication, in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Aberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole was significantly reduced by 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">Aripiprazole showed an efficacy in reducing manic symptoms in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some over 2 weeks were not based on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapy serum therapy, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxyregulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">"the mean removal time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole, with extensive metabolisation via CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in poor 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as with a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular danger for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimrotubules substance that promotes the composition of microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">"this stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions."</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel due to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved tranlsendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and occurs due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour.</seg>

<seg id="1530">"advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII)."</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advations are used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles, or inner organs."</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought in to enable the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">"advate is similar to a drug approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under 6 years, the application of the drug was examined for preventing bleedings and surgical procedures."</seg>

<seg id="1538">"the most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII."</seg>

<seg id="1540">"in March 2004, the European Commission issued approval for the transport of lawyers from the European Union to Baxter AG."</seg>
<seg id="1541">"dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient."</seg>

<seg id="1641">"normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues which connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected."</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"the virus in Advexin is a" adenovirus, "which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and can not cause infections in humans."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"the p53-protein, which is formed from the p53 gene, which is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered."</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerosze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced back to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a alleviation of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took Desloratadin on their own."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart-hunting), mouth-drying, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), somnolence (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, including adrenergic substances or lauatadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow-angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hypertension), hyperthyroidosis (cerebral haemorrhage), or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of aerosols across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without crushed, broken or chewing)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of absence due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fade.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued as monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"as Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, urgotamine, canniydrogeotamine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">"patients need to be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of the headaches) must be removed."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"in vitro studies, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the use of aerosols during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, have no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a presumption that can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery."</seg>

<seg id="1690">"in the case of an individual dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no impact on standard measurement parameters including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"in controlled clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"the oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"1,248 patients were involved with seasonal allergic rhinitis between 12 and 78 years, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"in both studies histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine on the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnic origin."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the plasma's administration."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"after the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolised."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine has been bioequivalent to the application of an aerinaze tablet after the single application of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"however, based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin could not detect any particular danger for humans."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"in reproductive toxicology studies, the combination of laurel / pseudoephedrine in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not teratogenic."</seg>

<seg id="1750">"since the histamine deficiency is a causal factor in all urinary disease, it is expected that Desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria, which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines."</seg>
<seg id="1751">"in two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval."</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"influenza pandemic outbreak occurs when a new stem of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from humans to humans, because people have not yet established immunity (no protection) against it."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as" "foreign" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"in this way, the immune system will later be able to make antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane of the virus with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a foreign body) was purified and used as a part of the vaccine."</seg>

<seg id="1933">"pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors have not been studied in children."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"generalism is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase Capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily."</seg>

<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of untreated amerase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"the studies included asgenerase solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value."</seg>

<seg id="2046">"therefore, the minimum concentration at Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption."</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound Amprenavir that represents the active portion, probably unchanged."</seg>

<seg id="2277">"the study focused mainly on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver)."</seg>
<seg id="2278">"in children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2279">"the most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion body."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills."</seg>
<seg id="2281">"Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to larvonidase, or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction)."</seg>
<seg id="2282">"every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will examine all new information that may be known, and where necessary to update this summary."</seg>
<seg id="2283">The makers of Aldurazyme will see patients who receive aldurazyme as regards the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>

<seg id="2290">"the safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients."</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">"for this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting, in which rehabilitation centres for medical emergencies are immediately available."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyma (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">"since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, it must be cautious due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of the treatment."</seg>

<seg id="2297">"in case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"in the event of a single severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2305">"adverse drug reactions related to aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 or over, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in some patients with severe MPS-I-conditioned participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"children's undesirable drug effects related to aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study), there were no detectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom there was never a Serokonversion."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"patients with lacking until low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined."</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effects on enzymatic larvonidase- activity in vitro that did not appear to interfere with the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for the enzyme replacement therapy is in a sufficient restoration of enzyme activity sufficient for the hydrolysis of the accumulating substrate and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"after intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells in the lysosomes, most likely via manic-6 phosphate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years."</seg>

<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as emerged from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volume increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"of the 26 patients with a hepategaly before treatment, 22 (85%) up to the end of the study had a normal liver size."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG level was observed in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"in terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients treated by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes for five efficacy variables (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and worsening in 9 patients (20%) were observed."</seg>
<seg id="2327">An open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">"in four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22."</seg>
<seg id="2329">"in several patients, a normal mental development rate (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe form of progression only limited or no progress in cognitive development had to be observed."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the drug approved for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug as an effective ingredient already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue detects damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme alanine amino acid (ALT) in the blood are heightened."</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheon submitted data indicating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was done (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increased again in more patients than in the case of reference medicines; Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crustaceans) and small infected infirmaries (crack or incision), abrasions and sewed wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillint Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not be effective against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years, the area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo had responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home patients, about 90% of the patients in both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective in treating abscesses (freezing cavities in the body's tissue) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo weigh in the short term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of altargo across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can begin."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary open wounds the efficacy of reapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skimmed skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in regards to a statement on effects on birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with altargo should be continued / terminated is to be weighed between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most common reported side effect was irritation at the destination that concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"reapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly Pleurotus passeckeranus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking P-binding interferences and prevents the normal formation of active 50s of ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, should a consultation be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-contact to S.aureus treatment, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on scented skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children from 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans according to topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 skimmed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>

<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats sign of reduced fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 skewed skin):"</seg>

<seg id="2723">"Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination schedule consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be completed by two doses."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinet adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of TwinX adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections."</seg>

<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients with a complete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"ammonia is - split up to several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered by a gastrostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube)."</seg>
<seg id="2809">"this was not a comparative study, as Ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a fake medicine, i.e. without active agent)."</seg>
<seg id="2810">"ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headaches, fainting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant odours or weight gain."</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammony in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"Ammonia was approved under" "extraordinary circumstances", "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information was available for this medicine."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"the use is indicated in all patients, where a complete enzyme shortage already manifests in newborns (within the first 28 live days)."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for the application if there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"for infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"the daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development."</seg>
<seg id="2817">"according to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg, as well as for adolescents and adults."</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinsilicobamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders because there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as in with sodium retention and edema."</seg>
<seg id="2823">"since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure."</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">"in the case of subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal proliferation slowed and increased loss of neurons."</seg>

<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin Molisin differs very slightly from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter working time than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two trials involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in Type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot operate insulin effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was diagnosed after six months versus a decrease of 0.14% in insulin pumps."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin sensitivity, or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH approval for the transport of Apidra in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be used as a subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active ingredient, the mark (her- plate), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or treatment of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphylenes, propoxyphylenes and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympatholytics, such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reserpin, the symptoms of adrenergic equivalent regulation can be alleviated or missing."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin allergy occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in mother's milk, nor is it resorbed to oral health."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed below are the undesirable compounds known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organcategories and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; inestimable (frequency based on available data)."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea, and palpitations."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"podystrophy Will be neglected to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a physician."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucolic injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscle and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous ga- be of insulin sensitivity, the effect occurs faster and the working time is shorter than for coughy normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin Molisin has twice as fast as normal insulin and achieves complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that a comparable postpranal glycaemic control is reached in 2 minutes before the meal, as with human insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"when insulin was removed in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control than with human insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was reached."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal commences, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with human insulin, which is given 2 mianuts before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin dosage in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal compared to human insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before a meal (figure 1A) before a meal (Figure 1B)."</seg>
