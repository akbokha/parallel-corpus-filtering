&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the total &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; in the worst case bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not depend on important decisions without checking the translation before . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can add translated texts directly . &quot;
package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . in spite of their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Guide to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; load , select Settings extensions ... Open the map tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard installation modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Canc@@ el . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module feeder filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root note of the document , example : DVI element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects into ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller , or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , you can easily recognize large files , even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle switched over view mode can be either depth for easy detection of the sh@@ ading depth or the image of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles are used ( whereby , thus , representation errors may occur due to restrictions on the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ ap display algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always maintained . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the square is square . &quot;
&quot; as division of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for labelling and avoiding space losses due to frames that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View on the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; original was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;
the module Picture Gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery module , a dialog opens , allowing you to set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the Pictures per line option has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each row in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box file name of the image , you specify whether the file names will be displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you specify whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the Fol@@ der folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the File menu Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy the original images to the gallery if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the check box comment file you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box sel@@ ectable color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be defined here :
you can find media playback for the navigation pane in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; changes the mapping in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this old browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry Con@@ figuration ... you can set the size of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Module check your &amp; CSS ; style templates and &amp; HTML ; documents based on W3@@ C &apos;s recommendations and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Extras Website . you can perform the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; Veri@@ fication check , if your &amp; HTML document is the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds to all found errors displayed . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are correctly displayed by all browsers . &quot;
allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your websites have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser you use .
check the links on your page on further lines and faulty connections . it will recur@@ sively check all links on the website .
here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
with the module Web @-@ Archi@@ ver for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save web pages with text and images in .@@ was format .
click on Tools webpage with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed website .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and digi@@ ti@@ ze your photos ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded using K@@ DE image plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . &quot;
&quot; wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you are using these short@@ cuts , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ kam , is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . &quot;
you can also learn the digi@@ kam website to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best way to get started is signing up in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ kam , for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ yss is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ kam , will use it in addition to the Al@@ ben@@ library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as a base folder . no image will be changed . while browsing the folders , you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , immer@@ se recur@@ sively the path path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . this lets you insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . then , you should learn how to use My Albums and My stit@@ ches to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu with camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and digi@@ ti@@ ze your photos ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras exc@@ el through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a disk drive . the connection can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ v@@ ates . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digital cameras , which supports a continuously increasing number of more than 800 cameras , also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a wide @-@ spread protocol designed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated now . &amp; digi@@ kam , supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plu@@ gins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function , as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam , perform themselves . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the al@@ b tree , via the horizontal divi@@ der or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - A file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed , you can configure the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was first created , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album Import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way , and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to share information about this collection . to access the album properties , you will need to right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method of marking your albums , so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you choose to add or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view Albums Date sort by date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ dest , average , newest : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . to do this first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first create an album &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ aks . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; When album preview &quot; &quot; ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the thumb@@ nail . what information is available , you can digi@@ ti@@ ze settings . select the Albums tab here and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appear . the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such help window .
&quot; photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam , goes . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . the image editing features your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and edit ... select . in the Edit menu , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; it may occur that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs , find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , provides two options for turning . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ heim of &amp; k@@ de ; shifted . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ cker quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam , use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing this , you can organize your key words lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch @-@ list , so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New Key@@ word . if you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the sub@@ title of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then , a menu gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in a tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Set Album &quot; &quot; in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you &apos;ve selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch quot ; you can also click the thumb@@ nail on the thumb@@ nails and select the keyword from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have finished a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the thumb@@ nail preview in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the tags that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ et@@ ally adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you will find a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search is done . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the form to enter the search appears again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit an advanced search , you will find more rules for the search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; in the context menu . &quot;
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . any option can be added to this list with search group / keyword list . each option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere above the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can drag the mouse wheel , zoom in or hold it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ tly from the context menu . when you are back in &amp; digi@@ box ; main window , you can quickly open the lamp with L Extras lumin@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area can be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited for quick sorting out of a picture series . if you use pairs of pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the areas to compare . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions work directly from the be@@ acon , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lamp table . this makes it easy , for example , to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed sides . to wave the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom in the same way as in other views . just use the Zoom slider under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom in . this happens in both pictures when you are in the mode preview .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos . here , we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam , use . we are looking at downloading , ren@@ aming , extrac@@ ting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transform@@ ations , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exported contents which have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam . the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location , unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant flow of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes pile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option to save metadata from the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam , to enable EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data to be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and valuation to any photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos when you work on . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you are often called by other programs , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the modified keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords , the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to let your photos only see you , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help Him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the turn of the spatial presentation is already running with speed of light .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are numerous and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by pictures with geographic information . this then shows the photos at the location of the site . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam and should be stored as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the offer field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which you can find the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate error , disk failure , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prepar@@ edness , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated careful and you can no longer trust them for a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself . in spite of this massive protection , they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
&quot; some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT fixed errors indicate the im@@ minent failure . the expected lifetime value is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; during most electrical devices electric sho@@ cks do not matter much , this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and replaces the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not each connector bracket also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and order the system ordered shut@@ down . in addition , the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs ; A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end you should always remember to drink all cables before you go on holiday .
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data on the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and a distributed memory is included in the offer . &quot;
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of faults per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that uses Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % on job systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than , for example , theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been not si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the examination process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras .
&quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anybody else for data loss . so , secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , lightning strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget aer@@ op@@ lane pieces : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ aster prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup has been made .
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up to your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens comp@@ resses and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh . &quot;
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . any further th@@ inning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; metadata , stored in the image file , retained IP@@ TC information , associate X@@ MP files , original retain , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visibility , ... , Internet usage . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all what is being said today with caution and re @-@ assess while the time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than to let the current system backwards compatible . the less versions you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and set the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition . * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; size of the disk in MB@@ gt ; # functions with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of disk if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save a lot more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open @-@ format image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and oblig@@ ated to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to em@@ bed the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers drag it to an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits in , since it stores the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you are using D@@ NG as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include annual conferences and workshops , standard links and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use it as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your crude archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the pictures with digi@@ ti@@ zing , then you should add the metadata again . these were trun@@ cated by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam , to get . in addition to adding a photo to an album , you will find a description how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Desk . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , use it , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single record in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected . the selected button is di@@ gest@@ ed until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is shown , like normal folder , shown . you can read the list of existing albums as normal folder . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by using the Clear All Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , then you must select them first and then delete them . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded from the camera ; you should carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera . if you want to delete the camera completely , you should do this about the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are typically used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image is made , into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . &quot;
&quot; the first two are the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix of fot@@ os@@ - % Y@@ - % -@@ % d % H : % M : % S . for further modifications you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name option , you can change the file names in lower@@ case when you download . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam , used for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Tool@@ bar section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t provide this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , use this to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ bottom option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ kam , you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and that can be displayed on a map . identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map reference . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
the download of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save these data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs with ha@@ iry coordinates , which are created e.g. from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ kam , try to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to change in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into 8 pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action to preview or start image processing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the name that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group resp@@ . agency that provides the image should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the data base of &amp; digi@@ kam . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this way , your cap@@ tions can also be read by other image viewers . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse @-@ cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam , supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , try to add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions has been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . in the image processing , this View Mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease image quality since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files , you can enable the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the default algorithm is los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . &quot;
&quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default reference is that all green pixels are the same . if you are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light as the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option marks the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is based on a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned on , because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights , as they display the pointed lights in various ro@@ ars . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ rap@@ ie try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ constructing option , you get the option to set a level . here a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be made later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ xing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ization @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ ie . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . it is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , as it is carried out during the conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information about how to translate colour information from one color space to the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile folder Sets here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures color @-@ administr@@ ated not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be adapted to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this might be corrected manually , rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . this is why a table of cameras and profiles will fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and they will then be digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings , short commands . &quot;
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob regul@@ ates the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show on the left a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you can attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; check if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the Option dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ ly@@ mer , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without rel@@ inqu@@ ishing . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the editing screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to disable when starting . this speeds up &amp; digi@@ kam under certain circumstances .
&quot; the setting B@@ oth start to look for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam , to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if anything was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam , it asks if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam , to custom@@ ise the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the tool@@ bar in Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and correct and improve . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules please refer to section Image editing .
&quot; status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or Save button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using from the File Recovery menu or using the button The Rest@@ ore image processing re@@ producing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have taken in the photo since last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost any action in the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing or re@@ covering editing , by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo , and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB file in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom in in that you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can edit the tool@@ bar in the Edit dialog box . &quot;
if you want to print the current image you can print in the File Image menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Assistant from the File menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam window has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation file , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same tab will allow the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the border again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; after you have commented on , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
the review section displays a score of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the keyword list shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the &quot; &quot; Key@@ word filter &quot; &quot; section . &quot;
&quot; keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then , a dialog appears that asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter stands on a keyword , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every startup of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic is based on colour management , everyone would like to know which buttons to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow . &quot;
&quot; if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
&quot; your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limiting s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can actually see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB are flas@@ hing on s@@ RGB . if you are working as RGB standard , you either need to connect your monitor to s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . use it therefore before attempting any further manual processing .
&quot; the norm@@ alization , balance , automatic balance and contrast expand from the Con@@ duc@@ er Automatic correction menu automatically attempt to make the most of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the lumin@@ ous intensity across the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; it is a very powerful operation , which results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in the image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic Adju@@ st@@ ment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright bor@@ der@@ tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
&quot; enlarge contrast , this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible range and a restart of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly restricted as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is used . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your chances of correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Col@@ ors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub @-@ window . &quot;
the target image preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
&quot; the default settings reset all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter Color Management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under Color Quality Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for multiple shots . this is useful if your camera or scanner always have the same error and therefore always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam product has four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was developed when the delicate areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by that it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply ; it beauti@@ fies many photos .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via provides very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repe@@ ats the thickness of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can weigh the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not un@@ common to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can then experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all the changes you can perform can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound quality correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the pane and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the control and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
&quot; three controllers : the top one for the dark tones , the middle one for the light tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ outs can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input rate . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically reset for all shades , medium and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ loading In@@ dict@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of adjusting the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode is the most meaningful . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ ace to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output cores and that the associated image pixels become darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
&quot; select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ loading In@@ dict@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kanal . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the Chann@@ els Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are shown on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . this is especially handy when you activate the Mon@@ ochro@@ me option , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ brau@@ ght . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Over@@ loading In@@ dict@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the saddle tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ph@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam , applying mould texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed one ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce covers it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the frame decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this can also be done in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text mode , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool sten@@ cil to place a template over a picture .
the Image template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , please send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you must set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail automatically . &quot;
under the Pre@@ view are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shrink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other fields .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharp . in fact , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ otrop@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that the dig@@ itali@@ zation process is a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed if ink points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more retro@@ spec@@ ation than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; for JPEG pictures , a camera has often been used in internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a field filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by using a picture with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use this with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; you should handle it carefully , as the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can re@@ focus the sharp@@ ness of an image . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ tening and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ me from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first be tried . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges will produce . &quot;
the radius will show how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount . thus , a minimum difference is defined to be applied to an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore , beauty defects are avoided in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted escape @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results as blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your blur@@ red gauge is . this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformer matrix . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . however , please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to make all the tri@@ mmer , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but will leave unpleasant arti@@ facts later . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could result in causing the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal lin@@ e@@ are filter . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original sharp color picture that needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the knob regul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of the range that has been dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the ink tin@@ ts allow a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly smooth@@ ed and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should ensure that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary retro@@ actively . please note that the level of detail should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction . &quot;
&quot; frequency depen@@ dencies Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ s evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD slides will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; repeti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here is 1 or 2 . &quot;
&quot; angle incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be cho@@ osen too . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stepping width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stepping width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow it to be om@@ itted . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . any setting of picture errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correc@@ ting picture errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and require a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove picture errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts removed . the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; the radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can blur@@ ring the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller bugs adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to determine light density changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or s@@ me@@ ar occurs again . &quot;
edges : checks the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you cannot remove the entire noise or noise tips can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ eplay vari@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more bol@@ der than the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased to its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system , and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cra@@ ck@@ le for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool for sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble sof@@ tening and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact @-@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uni@@ form@@ able noise is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700 camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts created by scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , tool Hot@@ pixel lets Hot@@ pixel of photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate those pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ ri@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it can reduce the edges and edges of the image by allowing the light to reach the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation with a center filter onto a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can check the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the default density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting correction being applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can almost be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second grade . with negative values , t@@ onal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion can be corrected . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth grade . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value will scale the image size and will result in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
brigh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview of distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or res@@ izing changes . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be apparent to the groove . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu or by removing the zoom controller of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , like shots from the front , frame and paintings , is the perspective to correct all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter text applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ bas@@ king effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny sight specifically in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film bas@@ tion effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed one ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural Images and Sti@@ ll Life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large pictures . smooth checked the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel image is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage leaf . the lines that outline the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch yourself .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engra@@ ver marks your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter en@@ grav@@ ings is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ tane landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ visible : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph taken from a car or train . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ ten@@ er blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
vibr@@ ating sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the image and blur@@ ring it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the picture into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the Be@@ ast button at any time .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses an algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing a range free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right orientation by mirrors or turning . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation such as Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is placed , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge Any input for photo can be saved as text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ ast button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by adding a small image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo you just need to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this allows you to change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply clicking the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button &quot; &quot; C@@ trl + + X &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save file under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait mode , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio cutting uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range to crop up to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the mapping tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the help aid enable you to hide help , so that you can get your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ bows , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . &quot;
the golden center provides more fluid guides when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you nearer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third @-@ level rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the golden spiral mentioned above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place on these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal and Ver@@ tical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
&quot; with the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ forming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
turn your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the pres@@ ets button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function transformer cutting from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally crop function . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ s the image a bit after the rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the upper left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the upper right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double @-@ strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with a transformation from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal shift , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted in a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module through Transform@@ ers sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using Horiz@@ on@@ tal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; your help will display a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sha@@ vings generate twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF under it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam , only shows files in formats that know . this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file will be digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour with very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw video converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; convert . in the configuration section , you will find further information on how to use Mod@@ ules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of rough images only with the program d@@ rap@@ ie which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . this is where more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often edited in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . &quot;

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
&quot; use a uniform dialog type displaying the effect in a preview before applying the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you will see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture Application &quot; &quot; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizont@@ ally divided without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar properties displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can drag the mouse wheel , zoom in or hold it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the Palette Box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the tick box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected , you can set this mode by selecting the check box heading under the cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character when another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of color sel@@ ections can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color choos@@ er on the left side .
&quot; Gra@@ phs are used in science , especially in computer science , . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing such programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ phs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graphs showing all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ graph ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; rec@@ al@@ calcul@@ ates the graph and is presented in &amp; k@@ litho@@ graphi@@ cally ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in a &amp; kate ; -@@ component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and one h@@ ack to show more than these k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needed in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without any special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file was modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item settings k@@ rep@@ viewer ; set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; or to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it using the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice and change it later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Rest@@ art Download page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time . &quot;
opening is the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the session administration page gives you the option to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or to be asked when you start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ rounded graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ time model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used which is syn@@ onymous with multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm generates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ tigen @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice to treat large and clu@@ st@@ oned graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circular according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . using such a layout command , you can input the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . using such a layout command , you can specify special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I Module to read images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source you want to pick up the image here . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by setting the default duc@@ r@@ he default values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before using the button to scan the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings might not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
after you have pressed the button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 by saving the image .
screen Photos you can create after you have selected in the menu Im@@ ported - &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver ... a window appears in which you can set up the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world that show photos of your camera and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . thus , it is used for your authentication . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at present , you will not need any other per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as tags during the upload .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered in maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is currently not a documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ .com can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can combine a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . in order to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation performs the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera size must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . here , set your camera time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS @-@ time and camera width . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the Inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference options can be used if you have no matching dates . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog changes the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set up with the shown map . choose the region you want and enlarge it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can export the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the panel has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab &quot; &quot; Ap@@ pear@@ ance &quot; &quot; defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture a new page will be created in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred while generating . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses in quality and metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as there is no compression of the color information . this is also reflected in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently not a documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the cc@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out exi@@ v2 , to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the video format . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD formats for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . then you can start the module via Extras m@@ peg dic@@ uss@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed among image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the next step is to specify the time in seconds the picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the created file can be set in the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your preferences , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings icon at the bottom . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful for improving or printing directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats : JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : expect d@@ rap@@ ie not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter Window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now reset the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information from your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and then add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected have already been attached .
do not be sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the sending e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments on the pictures will be merged into a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format Menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original export data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . by closing the button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transfer option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , as otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option allows the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images to be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually start with Es@@ c ; cancel .
the option to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
&quot; the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
&quot; there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect . &quot;
&quot; during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the lower left edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ k currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . how you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in each group , thus in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have given your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are visible . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of pictures shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails in order to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person , store your own preview image , this also applies to locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . &quot;
&quot; you must , however , select which image to display for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to open the image acquisition window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the image to your preferences and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties . you can view this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the Lab@@ eling or Description field , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try the same functionality you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , start the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; launch demo . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
&quot; each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate to the preview window . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can access via the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before you create HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and purpose . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the moment and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
&quot; last but not least , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed that is obvious to the viewer . for example , that all pictures are from a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; below on the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . by doing so , those who have viewed your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is stored and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started . if you select a URL for the base folder , the URL should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . for the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the currently described settings have all three based on base folders and URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images will be described , which you can access via the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices for you :
&quot; when you manually copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Automati@@ cally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the images are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , simply select the Export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories will match those in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it just has to be easy to browse and look at pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside various picture groups . if you see pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been launched as a program for managing your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual will talk about images , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu item Pre@@ ferences k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings will be explained .
&quot; on the left you can see six different icons with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
&quot; in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up entire membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
&quot; the modules can be called through the modules menu . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call about the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of several applications are used together with each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . this is why you should either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or over the Help menu . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you are using the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected people to view and share it with the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the settings dialog and select which modules to load . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and a tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you can browse through your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture has been taken , etc . , if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included . &quot;
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by moving the used names upwards , find the people faster and al@@ locate . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon at the date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail in the upper right corner . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window showing the USA as a group . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to sort this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it out of the window .
&quot; if you have adjusted the window &apos;s appearance to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then click on the window to see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all pictures in case you do not set a filter . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the respective images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be uploaded from your hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from folders and to copy it back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end you want to remain un@@ available for others and click Now View all the images that your little sister can see , control and lock the menu item Every@@ thing except up @-@ to @-@ date view . &quot;
&quot; you specify which images to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the Menu Add images , whereby all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this image protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to for@@ bid the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason you all want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and let it go somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the button image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom in . you can simply zoom out the zo@@ om@@ t using the mouse button . using the minus key , you can zoom out the zo@@ om@@ ic plus button in the middle of the image and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the &quot; &quot; Power &quot; &quot; button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out are tagged with the plus and minus key .
you can rotate the image using the context menu from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
&quot; when you view images it can happen that you can find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a mark by clicking on the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to view categories in the preview screen , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the mark after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will be allowed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to stop the painting mode from the context menu . to stop the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a notification is displayed with an error message . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to be able to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when editing a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press on preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under one view , drag the anus to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ dri@@ p in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map signs at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the anus on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the front panel . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the front panel . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any position . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window arrangement ... Store . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; when you have created a scene you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each rendering mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to have a name that lets you know the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image cut@@ out to render into the input fields . &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mock sample or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this feature look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling does not include the adjacent pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive , because each pixel is repeat@@ ed@@ ely divided and adaptive because the rec@@ ord@@ ability depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished you can find the reason for this .
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ scene , select the File Im@@ ported menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross High Detailed Delivery for Exten@@ ded Proj@@ ections , all the wi@@ re@@ model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you anchor the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section you will explain how to create and store window orders .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window instructions . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list Exist@@ ing window orders displays all existing window instructions . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
&quot; with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with a card card , you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating in the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later guides , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the App@@ ly button or press paste button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert End@@ less Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the En@@ ter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the layer extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pigment looks just a matte black material because you still need to type settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and bul@@ let in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then call the Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
you should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic principles of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be as easy as the floor :
&quot; in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to apply the input key or the user button ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example , in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the En@@ ter key .
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection already result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered are some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ed command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here , you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands pres@@ et with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to craw@@ l over rough surfaces without having to model every b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying a picture file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
use &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Ein@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background color will also be filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can configure &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
speci@@ fies whether the slideshow will begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
res@@ izes the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user helping his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shot , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions about other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should be powerful this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to join &amp; show@@ shot ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ shot ; attempts to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; the settings dialog is divided into 8 pages . you can switch between them , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sc@@ ou@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer can scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not make any more than scan and save images . for each image you can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner , cancel and termin@@ ate . &quot;
the other settings include more detailed driver options . &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; in order to scan a picture , the user can start a preview can and then scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out the current selection . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back into the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type as &amp; can@@ l@@ ite , save images . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select mem@@ os without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images that are automatically stored and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button About starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the About starts the K@@ DE Help dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to quit &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite .
&quot; the GP@@ L is licensed and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , used by &amp; can@@ l@@ ite , is licensed under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and select Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . click the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... Select .
you can set up your multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions from the collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
require &apos; Res@@ cue &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to run external programs and commands . this will usually use the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to show the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now add more information to the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ bit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files , if a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . in order to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; quit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script pack@@ ets downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be found with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the creation of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets right . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you will find just a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; you may have already a few play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the Play@@ list browser is exactly the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music ! &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window is shown . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; store mood files on the music files : this feature is only available when compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist on the exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece visible when changing the piece causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
switching to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting attachments of own type@@ faces , the otherwise gray presented section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can design@@ ate your own color scheme . use the color selection activated below for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continuing playback will cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece that has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for selecting colors . if sel@@ e colors do not use activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate further settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting , as to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the ti@@ cked as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
&quot; monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists added to your collection in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the Play@@ list browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation Field Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another device is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : if the database is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under Port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card file supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; enter your username and password for your load profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces played and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some features , such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file causing the crash .
most of the time this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; but G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this results in crashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , de@@ activate autom@@ . off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( chance mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily clari@@ fied by using an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error , if something is due to the fixing of an error in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start window has been converted into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist , select the playlist and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s that simple : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a backing @-@ independent approach , so the actual question must be supported by Wel@@ sh media types : G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously transmit audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with a hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different link ( e.g. sink ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you just want to listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . check sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ MO co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA fix@@ ture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . sign @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download mu@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all of the m@@ peg files in the module folder ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions or wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides the name contains the magical K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running unit : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable User@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA is present .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Window . to do so , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size changeable . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ trl + Right click a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the input key after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the Control bar section ? &quot;
click on the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; set the CD , then click to play audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece was played , the less influence each individual score has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself , by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialogue metadata . &quot;
developers do not want to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that isn &apos;t related to the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok that some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select setup tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design . &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . in order to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
the Con@@ quer@@ or navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; as you browse in the Con@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok .
audio c@@ robat is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . audio c@@ robat is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a hint from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator , then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; set up Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio Output enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the direction dialog from x@@ ine now and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable m@@ map to support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be looked after . you may of course like to take this issue yourself ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collections browser to the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection facilitates the search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the button of the playlist to save it . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; when you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist . if the playlist is included in your collection &apos;s folders and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you will already be in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the burning menu . here you have various possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . like any normal multimedia player , it has many different ways to control your music collection . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a running text displaying the current piece or current stream . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the button E@@ Q is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that are not available in any other player , but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information about the current piece . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub @-@ windows are explained in detail later . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the start window is off . the information presented there has now been divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information displayed there is now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . additionally , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Tools statistics ) . &quot;
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece as well as the artist and the album .
&quot; the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , the artist and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find further information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context @-@ browser will also display covers images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the album &apos;s content . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages by using self @-@ written scripts . if no text script is running , you can choose which script should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted by genre and then sorted by artist .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is also sorted by album below the artist . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing as you like . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
a search filter is located directly under the tool@@ bar . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This gives the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
hang on play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
insert pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer the pieces into the queue to transfer to the Media Player . for more details see the Media @-@ Player @-@ Browser section for more details .
all pieces of this interpreter will burn / Bur@@ n on CD - so the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the album is shown no longer under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser designs the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the Play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it needs to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . by doing so , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area where you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter , for example , tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter key , you can access the music from there to the music playlist and drop it . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by a simple case can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all the pieces attached to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location . in order to reset the filter , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button for a long time until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; enter by spaces separate search terms , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then wrap the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field does , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax versions as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left @-@ hand side , you will find the Add button to which you can add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you want in the player window over the right mouse button . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and selecting tool@@ bars ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , you can disable the Status bar option in the General settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . using this menu you can access the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
one click on this entry will open the window Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can choose the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting Ac@@ tions Cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue administration has received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already specified ( the details for setting up these are later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill in your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , and add more random pieces while playing . &quot;
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ robat ) . this mode requires that already some pieces are in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then select Lo@@ ad . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix now fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece to your collection . the Recommen@@ ded items will be added at least one piece , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu item , the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again . &quot;
the New Tab button lists the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
&quot; right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be double in this playlist . &quot;
plays - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have recently been played .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each play . if you click here for more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you want to add . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ scripts , by clicking on script . it will open a dialog box in which a script package can be selected for installation . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information to write your own scripts , please refer to the section Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re @-@ encoding you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As will be shown with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
&quot; if a project is modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it just as if you were called for any project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you were calling file Cl@@ ose .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button Bren@@ nen , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful for you to view files from a previous session to the current project .
&quot; this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it only blocks the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; open the CD copy dialogue . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you want to burn later on . you should also use cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
&quot; a previously generated CD image will burn . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; a previously created DVD image is burning . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , its contents will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator when starting the wizard . &quot;
opens the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; as many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial , which will give you the preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video D@@ v@@ d ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String stem@@ ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Path ) void _ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void _ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be recorded audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on your computer . &quot;
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ ders need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on your computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ - ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while the setup dialog only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained afterwards . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert to many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . for example you can find more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data starts in accordance with the installation of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the code settings tab in the Setup Cat@@ alog - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available , so that the selection with another enco@@ der can be read as the default . note that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog . &quot;
opens the File Manager so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; ex@@ its ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main direction dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , with different card cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; when no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music by young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , adding the &amp; CD ; adding titles to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audio creator ; parameters needed to be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs instead of entering the information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( assuming the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being inflic@@ ted on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflic@@ ted . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the program@@ mer who has verified the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates to the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , look in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before using the enco@@ der . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the sp@@ elling and read rights to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission on it ( eg by trying to copy something into the / usr / share / cd ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audio creator , something that is probably done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what each reading &amp; CD must be repeated .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( .@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them when reading a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found once . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive exists , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card General settings . here you do not have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only for incomplete information will be asked , so that you will be informed when data for generating keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both records . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , you can easily change the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter all manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , check this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server nearby . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as regards the server , as many fire@@ walls run the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be disabled . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously permitted pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try himself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) . &quot;
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of wa@@ v files at the same time : with a dual core or a quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it can be attempted to code more than a wa@@ v file simultaneously . &quot;
this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; it is used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly you never need to change it again .
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually , instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this is not done , consult the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you did not select the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , can be used for each piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments drawing together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this option is set up on the encoding settings tab , and take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the code to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at a time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the Select menu option to read out the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what exp@@ ires . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read out on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message tells you if you try to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred immediately after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . this enables reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . in case of performance weak machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , a part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you are reading this , you &apos;ve probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be customized to suit your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step , for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various learning flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still read on ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any clu@@ e how it will go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to add or change it , may it do . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; wei@@ rd , if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need them , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke game from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Project Driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; can drag &amp; drop windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid detects automatically the used method .
&quot; session support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop the window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid , a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with multiple pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template and change the game speed . to get the original speed again , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected that uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke lyrics . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries from the menu Settings menu items or song events . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI Files , which you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find them in the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you exit the application , this collection is not saved . remember , if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the drop @-@ down menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song button , record next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ vious piece , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which transforms all the events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and can therefore sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you must edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the necessary conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so do not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument requires to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; of the patch is meant , where each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several keyboard maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are mainly used to map sounds on the percussion channel . look at the included Key@@ boards as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply do this in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name Name is used for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events be multiplied by the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the Map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is a pitch Ben@@ der event , should play a sound higher with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds higher up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . in the Settings menu , you will find the MIDI Settings menu . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano no@@ ises ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you see what sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not g@@ lows green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number the greater the speed .
&quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this is because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; OK , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; before that , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open up A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am studying , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a postcard or MIDI file , I will contact &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may already have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody for it . I would like to stress that I only want to be more program@@ mer because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .

and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category &quot; &quot; Last@@ ly Play@@ list &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you get an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . to do this simply click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and as next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select from the menu Ab@@ same with playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without using the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation when starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tain@@ able option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f . &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer deliberately .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be done by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ co@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special em@@ bed field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages you need to specify the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE .
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; so that always a given back@@ end is taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on will play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; and K@@ M@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; internally , different names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ vies , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . &quot;
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is called root after plu@@ gging the device . it is absolutely necessary to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts slowly but why does my CPU need to be tested for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taken . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . among Unix @-@ like systems is probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ tra@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . the documentation of the distribution resp@@ . installation CD ; / DVD should be used for the installation .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; -@@ website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the Ki@@ le ; -@@ website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; box ; offers the opportunity to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with reading the chapter Working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while there is only a good news @-@ view to &amp; lat@@ ex , it is not the ultimate book about it . to speak properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ file class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document . some can also be made to the document related settings .
&quot; this includes the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compl@@ ying with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users do not have to worry about this . it is only a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; when setting a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) , a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) will automatically create a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu item box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into some elements . lat@@ ex ; enables the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex , file search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; device @-@ independent file &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ cked ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; There are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the retri@@ eval search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . once cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code , the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is inj@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is called &quot; &quot; rib@@ bed &quot; &quot; and no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be found . the selection boxes have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the check box For further information is available for entries like keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created . &quot;
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection box ) .
when using quote a selection list with literary entries will be displayed . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is attached to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop down sel@@ ector with the name of the letter is used for defining the fonts . you can define the fonts for the main text , the mer@@ its notes , etc . the following fonts are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ cking , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the bottom up with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ folders contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the fonts . if the fonts are not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the volume building or the quick mounting of a button . &quot;
the source code must be saved in front of the compile . &amp; box ; for saving it automatically .
&quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . when using quick build &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font Sets 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } want to create a change of fonts within the environment , &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ling &quot; &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the changes are only carried out within the environment ( \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many ways to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold prints , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the cur@@ sive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le will follow . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed out or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as Prin@@ ter , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre@@ text search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . only Modern can be set up under Settings box ... Tools can be selected .
&quot; to execute the desired search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on thumb@@ nail . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then done then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this must be specified &amp; box ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as text editor ( settings Ok@@ ular set up ... editor )
&quot; if a fast conversion of the &amp; DVI file cannot open , an error can be made . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file tells the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , there is always a line where the error appears . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; box , navig@@ ating to the er@@ ron@@ eous line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document . more information about this can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users from &amp; lat@@ ex , usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering into the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ file class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated insertion of commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the template can then be selected instead of the standard ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template , should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very handy &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called by the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that clicking on \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source code and emphasize it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
many assistants can add additional jumping marks . these are a custom type of bookmark within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ t@@ Edit stu@@ ds or the respective button keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted in the first entry of a mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate ; already excellent features were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important features for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection .
&quot; he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not a text with transparent lines ( as in other text editors ) . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an expanded meaning , since this command also has an expanded meaning , as this command also has an additional star ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , this can be first selected and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key ; offers the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &quot;
del@@ etes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit Select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a more convenient work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ begin { environment } command will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command closes the recently opened surroundings , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the shi@@ mmer@@ ing bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the gra@@ ined bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jumped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted group cl@@ amps , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple reference marks are used as a sign . for the suitable implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple reference marks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this automatic insertion of the double be@@ zel can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. german or French ) , and there@@ with German or French versions . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when you click Shift , En@@ ter key , &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; box ; not only a line break , but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ ends with an adjacent line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; box ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in sp@@ read@@ sheets , and thereby arrange all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) each other . when clicking Shift , Alt , amp ; search &amp; box ; after the next tab in the following line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code execution offers , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes are implemented . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings box ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the click button is pressed , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to increase the completion list . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions can be added to these positions by means of the N@@ Ã ¤ th@@ est jump mark and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; fully able settings can be made to these lists . you can select different wish lists for &amp; tex , - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ ters of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for full @-@ time environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ begin must always be entered and a large list of environment commands is used . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for failure of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ time environment or pressing Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically added and \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; box ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; fully able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the wish list of the full screen for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... As an example of a drop @-@ down list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example , is included in the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced by the menu Edit or the C@@ trl + Alt key , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string . &quot;
&quot; large land@@ owners are not helpful for automatic failure . however , it has been found that many more people are written more than once in a document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... til@@ les can be destroyed . here , the tres@@ hold for display of failure can also be set . &quot;
&quot; the full @-@ size files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ liche Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and followed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ ordering pages . if the PDF output is en@@ acted , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the creation of comp@@ iling , converting and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Kit command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no inserted viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
a new project will be published about the project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the Script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows for exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can change in other versions of the API scripts .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ designed system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; box ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ Live ; are delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; it is a fully @-@ used manual for &amp; tex ; and its &quot; &quot; Friends &quot; &quot; use . it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but it is also ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three key book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; Deli@@ ver@@ ed , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and boxes ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ier and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; box ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; box ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X. &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signature command line interface produces random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; and add your signature in the bottom section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file storage or click on the disk symbol . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then , you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails for private or professional use , there are always plenty of signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then select Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user @-@ defined button on the right bottom and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for use &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signatures from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; the older the pile entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a call stack in the shown list , the cursor is transferred to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file in the main window . &quot;

you cannot choose one or more settings from the Settings dialog . each setting is supported by a help window over the effect .
no or more parameters can be added via the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt Parameter section of the dialog . this allows the transfer of parameter values to the style template .
&quot; to apply the changes you have taken , press the O@@ k button . &quot;
the dialog can be closed by clicking X in the top right corner of the window . if the settings are to be changed you should open the dialog once more .
&quot; once the style template is started , the Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ection menu can be selected . then click on the tab tab , as in the example below . &quot;
a fil@@ en@@ ame can be an absolute path to a local file . or just the fil@@ en@@ ame ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l ) .
&quot; a template or mode name can be a fully qualified name , with which the non @-@ local part is optional , e.g. x@@ s@@ l : my@@ template is also referred to by my@@ template &quot;
&quot; first click the stop point in the list of current stops , then press the Rem@@ ove button . &quot;
&quot; the status of a specific holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Settings Edi@@ tor@@ Settings dialog , on the Page Color . &quot;
&quot; you can disable , de@@ activate or delete a stop point using the buttons , the Deb@@ u@@ g menu or the icons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is captured and displayed either in the stage @-@ management ... Di@@ alogue or in the &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window . the following exceptions apply this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available via the Deb@@ ug@@ gen menu , whereby the management tool is most important . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , . all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation , knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we take it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the sought @-@ after working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply ha@@ i@@ ded . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed review option . &quot;
&quot; for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; for definition as well as for the Relax@@ NG check , speci@@ fying the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , already checked , then they let current file simply be selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or part , we start by using the Edit plug @-@ in menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ Element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often in a project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email messages are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for the information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . add@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
there can be either the note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is the role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project manager After the area and sub@@ project managers should be given the relevant area or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and rollers names are case @-@ sensitive but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the names : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages that is agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lower case @-@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal case @-@ sensitive means , the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case @-@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal case @-@ sensitive means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close optional tags : when checked , for tags for which the closing day is optional , it is inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
&quot; start and finish tag automatically : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . restore standard values using the Standard button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; generates regular backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the default window settings to the next start is useful when the user interface is crossed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it is equivalent to the --@@ reset layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by cont@@ acting non @-@ en@@ quiries .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set into details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins are part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be stated : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located on a standard there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin during startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ designed . support for the no longer needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plugin is available to add support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left corner .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action triggers the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally no attention has to be taken care of . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sound according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution starts . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , whereby , if possible , error @-@ adjusted in functions and include . &quot;
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set . &quot;

this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how to help you better .
&quot; type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / or CSS ; and tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbolic tags of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the Properties dialog for the tag . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bars allow for fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag directories carry the name of the description language and version so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than a single element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the method method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
converts a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only be used for any attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling the attributes in tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that is grouped together the elements of a list . it can only happen for one attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags that can be defined . this element is a single element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces should influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the tag@@ x@@ ml files the tools dialog at the top in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; this feature is currently not available . at present , the check is done only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ loaded .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; name _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for accessing DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with actions actions ... to be created . click New Action to enter the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut added to this action . clicking the user @-@ defined button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut , with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but there@@ on it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is attached to the PID @-@ number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can take input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , at the default input . in the input field input , it is possible to specify what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages read on the default output . it can be specified what to do with the text written to the default output , by setting the value of the selection box output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use , enable &quot; Edit Tag Edit &quot; dialog when available to enable input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; edit &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size to others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its file list ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tions = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the section &amp; PHP ; documentation like this : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently appears at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to create context sensitive help . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of context @-@ specific elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file by simply saving $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as sending DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with Email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it . the posts are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for a pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private g@@ pg key ( pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialogue New resource , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before the installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signi@@ fication . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with indicating the resource of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format might be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target Directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type definition line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , add &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . all that is selected as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; samples to tool@@ bars with special actions specially designed for the files of a particular project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , thus em@@ bedding the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please hit in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with current document entries , such as closing the current , other , or all file fron@@ ts , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS instructions to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the editor area leads to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown .
&quot; if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and to strip them . in the presentation with anti@@ trust lines for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of tree views available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button lets you retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refres@@ her the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ a@@ geable attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system aligned to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; how to secure and load them !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H is located in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why development , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; automation can dramatically increase productivity by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be expanded almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .

&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , conver@@ ges special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
convert the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
disman@@ tling and switching the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from time to time you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project ad@@ ministers . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by means of actions , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server wherever anyone can access them .
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; who has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insertion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the insertion by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in to disable it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the dic@@ ates ; -@@ version .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes may need time or unpleasant graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub @-@ window to be activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and change sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since , for example , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering names , file is filled in automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ sam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to paste files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for ser@@ vers@@ al scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let the files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , let not be attached . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the folder will be displayed and you can select a precise selection according to your properties . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the Pro@@ files window or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders available ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; Up@@ load profiles can be uploaded in the Pro@@ files window , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing to its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub @-@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete event actions when a previously defined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . currently , this behavior can not be influenced . &quot;
to open another project select Project ... from the project project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . open dialogue project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders also behave , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... with the right mouse button context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows to remove the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when programming . this option is useful when frequently up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project tool@@ bar in the Project or Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . best using the tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the Ad@@ ding tool bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool bar can be removed , the tool@@ bar can be renamed , or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified , which actions on this or other tool@@ bar can be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set Settings actions .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary forms are normally inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special documents are stored in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from one comment to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ based . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . you can use all file management functions for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the con@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project file tree view , you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and backup . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically configure them with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template list . if a root folder would be set in such a way , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows leading head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) using a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and adding templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ aise of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; the cursor is active in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is active , pressing the active cursor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the V@@ PL ; this allows you to modify the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows for example keywords on the column name and keyword key@@ wor@@ d@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is as usual in a word processor , by moving the arrows . the cursor works as usual . the marker functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or removal key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text is inserted , any other tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the She@@ et Wiz@@ ard or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . in contrast to other styles of style the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specified file and line number and later enabled . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a file name without path input . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the most loaded style template file name with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement will be verified with a pre @-@ age called my@@ ME or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP NAS that contains the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended according to the rules defined in the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each stream .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white marks . later a lot of other useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files while merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and reflects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a number of white signs you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differenti@@ ates itself in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are located in different folders , you can make the typing work easier by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 -@@ o destination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; open dialog opens the manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder for A , but for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is checked , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also drag and drop them : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , they in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . for some programming languages , where white marks are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individuals . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the composition column from the text , is interrupted at points where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
by a click with the left mouse button in the composition column in one of the windows the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will also be highlighted with the color background color for current range and each on the left appears a black bar .
&quot; sometimes , by automatic merging or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then , in these lines of text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text appears not in the final saved file , nor in a selection you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict , however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources to ignore options , or ignore Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , page , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the editing window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merging section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) .
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you will need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . however , if this option is checked , it will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board and manually copying the manual copy . be careful with this option , as you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the clip@@ board contents . &quot;
&quot; time ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use cart re@@ course \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep track of source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when it is finished and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be rendered more sc@@ ast@@ ly . on these systems the button preferences automatically displays an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the previous line ind@@ entation will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used range on the used operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are ignored . even when merging , white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart character &apos; \ &apos; and &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only use a line @-@ on @-@ page comparison , while others only use a line @-@ on @-@ page comparison , but then they might be disabled as a white sign . while merging this option , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; d &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow on very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Automati@@ cally skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will appear before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white signs are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further f@@ use . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is located globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
above the selection fields for encoding appears a short note about what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processor commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore the numbers or ignore Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart merging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you may want to perform several exercises at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to process many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder scan only the files that have been compared until then are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by folding the arrow keys for the left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be the same , if their entire content is identical . then , folders have the same color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist the merge cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories are active synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; immediately copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while merging one file after the other , the status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the direction dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the conver@@ sions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then C is used as the target in the three @-@ folder merging mode . B is selected as the target , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid merging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , restart / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you continue merging the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or resolve the problem in a different way before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually compiled , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged once again . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ é@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a leading pun@@ t. a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the links are treated like normal folders and searched for recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for potential recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confidentiality of the change date . it is not a real comparison . for example , the files are considered identical when the modification date has been lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; activate the Synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been given . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , as it is assumed that the other file was not changed either . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder merging view is visible while merging individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file directly , without first having to run the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merging from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative und@@ . or .. Inclu@@ ded . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link appears on a file or folder . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ tion of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a variation viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; however , two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now they are compact ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 has already indicated that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or will be going that way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not treated as identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing lyrics , suddenly , No sr@@ c has been removed ; appeared , and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and thus also not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , which show differences . this also causes identical files to be copied while merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ tops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , finish them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and multiple . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button lets you move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager , and the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands effect the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , you can move windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas . &quot;
&quot; if this box is checked , the name of the virtual work@@ space will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; cross this field indicates the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of the virtual work@@ tops . if it is displayed together with the name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this box is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this box is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty working areas are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems only .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , all virtual work@@ spaces appear horizont@@ ally and vertical in a vertical range , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with its contents .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set @-@ up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.@@ g . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to include a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you &amp; K@@ mag start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor as a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you &amp; K@@ mag can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically use your set @-@ up short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Simp@@ le &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; K@@ may also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can zoom &amp; magni@@ fier ; to do this , use a magni@@ fier area to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick causes pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick is causing pain . however , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you are suffering from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion .
&quot; the intelligent shifting activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . the smart move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; exec@@ utes a mouse click .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent shifting is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is shut down , the mouse button is left again , if no moving of the mouse happens . &quot;
&quot; this feature is activated in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a slider sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this option is selected , will be launched &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; available at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset after the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best way to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you wish to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you use the intelligent shifting in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . hereby , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but do not use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . safe zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text , paste it into the clip@@ board , or use any other action , where you will probably need to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a mouse click at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means that every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor remains . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain in the mouth of the mouse .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a dra@@ gging process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to talk to their computers for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases that are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that is later used for text output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialo@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages used without typing it . of course , the text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can match the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included into the word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a sequ@@ ential memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; properly setup , you can enter the phrases that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken word is attached to the disc . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry ke@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ds and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the learning card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding when the text is passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be made available on this page . the option of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ book menu or in the box for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Instant Talk , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the disc . with the selection from In the input field , the selected text passage is initially only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop down of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can choose to automatically save the text pass@@ book when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ book save the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text file is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the dictionary page contains a list of dictionary text@@ books . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ mouth documentation . the frequency of single words is simply calculated by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they are to be wei@@ ghted .
&quot; with this option you put a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words entered automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , you can either access the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default buffer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is checked , a sliding bar for text passes will be displayed with entries . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for voice output properly or not fully entered . open Settings to mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s of Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax like to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
/ usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option must be switched on as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use a kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth &apos;s settings dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with people unable to talk to print text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ generate . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a speech synthes@@ izer . a language synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&quot; before you can use it , you must install program speech @-@ dispat@@ cher and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the board box will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the General tab is shown in General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map @-@ tab speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card box will appear . this will automatically appear when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already established speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker will be used for voice output when an application does not provide a spokesperson .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ons ; -@@ system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and female voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de is started . see . now , you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least set up a speaker , you can launch the &amp; k@@ de voice output system . click on the General tab for opening this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create and read text orders . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the input field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar when reading , it disappears once the reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , stop , stop and resume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all settings changed on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text you want to read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; preview lines and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text you want to read , and select tools from the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; quot ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de message system , noti@@ fying you about events that you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can configure &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; for example to set up a message in which your nick@@ name occurs . by &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which comes to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ons ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ons ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to choose correctly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations or to choose appropriate language and voice or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ons ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after issue of warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card @-@ card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue is stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
string replace replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ons ; is provided with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that enable the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ form@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a spokesperson . for example , if you have set a female voice on the board , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters set up . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup dialo@@ gs will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like ; it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ ase . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; here a language is entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text application one of the languages mentioned here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ Mail &quot;
the application ID running programs will get you using the q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you may only be allowed to enter .
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; default &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the board , or to a speaker with specific properties . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ons ; a text is sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program pres@@ ides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access it with a click on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to get faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text comp@@ lies with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box . apply filters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the Language edition API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ line via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give

none of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ format filter , but when using the module for the festival site , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able actually work . furthermore , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; dict@@ ate ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the development team . &quot;
Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when you refer to the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bau@@ bles or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , first check if speech tun@@ er works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script of the SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ons ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dispat@@ cher is possible and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return post@@ sentences or phrases , repeat , pause , or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a spokesperson , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Sub@@ scribe to Add Sub@@ scribe to the list or click Edit , the Box Office Setup will be displayed . for example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be displayed below . details of the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text passed to festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be done automatically . in general , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to apply ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system domain as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thereby , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the job , the number of phrases and the currently processed sentence . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can go forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio board audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and managed . editions of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
set the speaking speed here . 50 % ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ W ; % about the double normal speaking speed . to allow these settings to be implemented the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ons ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning keeps the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text message is interrupted by message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text application is interrupted . if both the sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings , and the output of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special promotions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ons ; read no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; ma@@ iled when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ons ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker that appears in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this you can set the pre @-@ registration al@@ erts as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to store the settings for the notification into a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ons ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows you to start reading or stopping the entire word order , as only the first set needs to be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ons , a pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ limits filter filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . turn off the selection of speakers and enter text to read . to do this , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection is changed . of course , you need to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ons ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole block of text , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; then you can add or cancel text orders on the map , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change the filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and add a tabl@@ ature sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the character setting .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ r ) , al@@ erts , news , or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter from Ver@@ sions , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained file . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Sel@@ ection &quot; &quot; tab you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card @-@ card speaker ) . in other words : there are no subscri@@ ber features .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; dict@@ ate ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ am ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set characteristics . &quot;
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other features . you can also set several markers here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as the primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the Def@@ ault Spe@@ aker button and then use Spe@@ aker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and kt@@ am ; it was finished . most likely , you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved this is probably a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console , a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / keywords new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the audio board audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and available via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) Dis@@ connect either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
I do not create web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops , no longer set @-@ up or go back . on the tab order is displayed , the order only consist of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter inter@@ ferences ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general configuration of the speaking speed , but it is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; when downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request . &quot;
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; default setting is &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = Target option . for example &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ ff@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . for this purpose , you will find the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software at festival / li@@ b / keywords / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it produces the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Programs and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from dic@@ tation files . you need additional software to create this phone . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single integrated interface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after the installation , a new module will display network settings at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be fully installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device in general shows and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the dealer selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the default network settings , this selection will be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the Ri@@ der network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network interfaces :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; when selecting Automatic , TCP / IP settings are made from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , the TCP / IP address can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console , you can see if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . turn on an switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ... &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the host IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain specification by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed in the list with buttons Hin@@ on or Her@@ under . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group host to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit menu will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of known computers describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains some well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit ... Edit the known computer will be displayed .
&quot; it can perform one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediate in the system . in order to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
installing the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; instead , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf will be discussed ; changing configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated . &quot;
IP networks are currently being used with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focusing on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on the eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or if available , can D@@ H@@ CP be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small network , the IP address should be selected from an area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if the case of active DSL connections is another content than specified there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; p@@ ushes the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the default on the tape do not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a tape deck needs to be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before you use it , it needs to be format@@ ted before you start format@@ ting . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the belt name and the capac@@ it@@ ance &amp; k@@ dat , continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog box opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu item Test@@ ed ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box will appear for review . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape index file using the tape content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files located in it will be backed up to be stored on the same file system as the folder . &quot;
&quot; perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape recorder .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the load is loaded to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ector in the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the tape is dis@@ car@@ ded when loos@@ ening &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy exten@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ specific block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is the name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time when the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single log lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open the system log , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion , or according to typ@@ ed strings . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display the entry . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter concept is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select a different entry at this point . for example , in the log file system protocol , select the process name , and then enter the name of a process in the log file system , and then you will show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of level error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as log lines of the level indicator . the color display of log lines can be switched on setup dialog .
&quot; if you only want to display a specific process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , when you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filtering tool . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the To @-@ new lines option in the context menu of the main window to display all the new log lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log message from the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly develops to the standard for controlling program start @-@ up in the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go further on historical aspects here ( for example , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ it binary is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to run when you start the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , that is only started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks in@@ it at various points after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . in the beginning you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can manually edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and fix the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts from hand to command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script is called stop using the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server run@@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it ( resp@@ . stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ levels , or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this only happens when you extract an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new section . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the type number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting order numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore items thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice top@@ - or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board with cut out ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insertion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine is constantly re@@ aping . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the &quot; &quot; LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single &quot; &quot; and press the input button to start in the individual user mode . then edit the / etc / init@@ tab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check , if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without a message if their configuration files are not present or set up in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save them . either you will use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings . more flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; the password management board appears , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; this card only appears if for at least one file system restricted ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are available in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the File System File System with space limitation .
&quot; the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
