<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects into nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller, or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView; the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, you can easily recognize large files, even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle switched over view mode can be either depth for easy detection of the shading depth or the image of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles are used (whereby, thus, representation errors may occur due to restrictions on the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemap display algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView; this target is not always maintained. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the square is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as division of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for labelling and avoiding space losses due to frames that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View on the area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="60">"wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you are using these shortcuts, your web browser will open a page in the error report system."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and digikam, is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also learn the digikam website to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get started is signing up in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start & digikam, for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abyss is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">"later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digikam, will use it in addition to the Albenlibrary."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as a base folder. no image will be changed. while browsing the folders, you get a progress indicator like this:"</seg>
<seg id="68">"& digikam, immerse recursively the path path in its full depth. you cannot exclude subfolders, unless it is in hidden folder. this lets you insert a point in front of the name of the subfolder."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can be in & digikam; set up your digital camera. then, you should learn how to use My Albums and My stitches to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu with camera support."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and digitize your photos; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gPhoto2 library. of course, any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras excel through the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a disk drive. the connection can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivates. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"digital cameras, which supports a continuously increasing number of more than 800 cameras, also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a wide-spread protocol designed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is outdated now. & digikam, supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function, as the changes in & digikam, perform themselves."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the alb tree, via the horizontal divider or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- A file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name only works if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed, you can configure the AlbenSettings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="85">"view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos taken by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was first created, the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album Import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"in order to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way, and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to share information about this collection. to access the album properties, you will need to right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method of marking your albums, so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you choose to add or view albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view Albums Date sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the buttons Eldest, average, newest: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the section of the album. to do this first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first create an album & digikam, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteaks. this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select" "When album preview" "; in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the image window. each picture is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a moment while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image will be displayed below the thumbnail. what information is available, you can digitize settings. select the Albums tab here and adjust the thumbnail area to your preferences."</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window that appear. the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the Introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>

<seg id="110">"if a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. by doing this, you can organize your key words logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My stitch-list, so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs."</seg>
<seg id="113">"you can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New Keyword. if you click on an existing keyword, this keyword will become the subtitle of this keyword."</seg>

<seg id="149">"if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam. the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive, etc."</seg>
<seg id="151">"you may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location, unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a web page."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant flow of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% of work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes pile processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>

<seg id="155">"we also recommend the option to save metadata from the metadata in & digikam, to enable EXIF- and IPTC data to be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu."</seg>
<seg id="156">"now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, & digikam, a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important."</seg>
<seg id="157">"now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, captions and valuation to any photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos when you work on."</seg>
<seg id="158">"now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you are often called by other programs, or categories continue. all three are synonyms for the same thing."</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the modified keywords are edited by & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"the graph shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very coarse representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images."</seg>

<seg id="190">"the most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and replaces the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not each connector bracket also contains overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data."</seg>
<seg id="195">"in addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and order the system ordered shutdown. in addition, the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="196">A high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs; A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end you should always remember to drink all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>

<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">"the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. it's quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>
<seg id="205">"even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of faults per year."</seg>

<seg id="209">"data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than, for example, theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; has been not sighted for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="210">"open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common filesystems. find a very good English article here."</seg>
<seg id="211">"journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the examination process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost."</seg>
<seg id="212">"viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss."</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras.</seg>
<seg id="215">"a 750GB hard drive you get today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anybody else for data loss. so, secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives."</seg>
<seg id="216">"suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, lightning strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="217">"a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget aeroplane pieces: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data."</seg>
<seg id="218">"therefore, desaster prevention means always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar."</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. create multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">"rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up to your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed. this happens compresses and if you want to increase security via ssh."</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">"this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. any further thinning should be done manually after which you have made a complete review."</seg>

<seg id="227">"in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:"</seg>
<seg id="228">"as the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all what is being said today with caution and re-assess while the time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way than to let the current system backwards compatible. the less versions you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future."</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">"virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use."</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability and set the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition. * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">"check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"/ dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; the new record is / dev / sdc & dollars; size of the disk in MBgt; # functions with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of disk if necessary"</seg>
<seg id="236">"open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year."</seg>
<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save a lot more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can store in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open-format image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obligated to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to embed the & quot; image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers drag it to an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP fits in, since it stores the metadata separately from the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put it together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include annual conferences and workshops, standard links and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>
<seg id="244">"import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use it as temporary backup."</seg>

<seg id="296">"with Chroma-Subsampling, it is meant that images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation."</seg>
<seg id="297">"with the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression."</seg>
<seg id="298">"with the option TIFF files, you can enable the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the default algorithm is lossless."</seg>
<seg id="299">"with the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG."</seg>
<seg id="300">"in earlier versions of & digikam, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing."</seg>
<seg id="301">"the default reference is that all green pixels are the same. if you are sensitive to ultraviolet light as the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option marks the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard it is based on a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned on, because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights, as they display the pointed lights in various roars. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam, and drapie try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much colour or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the reconstructing option, you get the option to set a level. here a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image."</seg>
<seg id="308">"set the Luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be made later in the image options of & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively."</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaxing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">"after some tests, it looks like AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenization-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Drapie. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges. it is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result."</seg>
<seg id="311">"if you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, as it is carried out during the conversion."</seg>

<seg id="317">"the input profiles should be adapted to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. currently, dcraw Gamma isn't corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping itself."</seg>
<seg id="318">"there are other options like the Soft-Proof-Profile, which allows you to emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture, as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this might be corrected manually, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer."</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. this is why a table of cameras and profiles will fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the topic is based on colour management, everyone would like to know which buttons to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to sRGB colour space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image editions are by e-mail or the Web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of limiting sRGB compared to the colors we can actually see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB are flashing on sRGB. if you are working as RGB standard, you either need to connect your monitor to sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. use it therefore before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the normalization, balance, automatic balance and contrast expand from the Conducer Automatic correction menu automatically attempt to make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the luminous intensity across the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shaded. this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"it is a very powerful operation, which results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in the image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic Adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright bordertones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"enlarge contrast, this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a restart of all values in between. this is only visible in full-washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly restricted as a color space with 8-bit per color is used. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your chances of correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the sub-window."</seg>
<seg id="398">The target image preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the default settings reset all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires more disk space, computing time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under Color Quality Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for multiple shots. this is useful if your camera or scanner always have the same error and therefore always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam product has four color effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also known as Sabatier, an effect that was developed when the delicate areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by that it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply; it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia provides very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repeats the thickness of the neon light. for large images, the filter can weigh the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not uncommon to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can then experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation rather than increase it. all the changes you can perform can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound quality correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of sliders for the purpose described here."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders are clicked into the pane and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the control and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the top one for the dark tones, the middle one for the light tones and the lowest for the middle notes, often called gammasts."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinouts can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input rate. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharp. in fact, it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychotropic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitized images require correction of the sharpness. this is due to the fact that the digitalization process is a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed if ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more retrospecation than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"for JPEG pictures, a camera has often been used in internal sharpening. images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a field filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by using a picture with the sharpening tool. you can use this with the menu entry Corrigible sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should handle it carefully, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can refocus the sharpness of an image. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for softener with the menu entry Corrigible softening and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove slime from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first be tried. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges will produce."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius will show how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount. thus, a minimum difference is defined to be applied to an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore, beauty defects are avoided in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred mask. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). fuzzy masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted escape-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocus usually reaches better results as blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's fission. the Gauß'sche fold has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter when your blurred gauge is. this is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformer matrix. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. however, please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to make all the trimmer, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but will leave unpleasant artifacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could result in causing the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blurring. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal lineare filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original sharp color picture that needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the knob regulates the blurring of the range that has been darkened, in order to create a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tints allow a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly smoothed and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should ensure that no sharpening is necessary retroactively. please note that the level of detail should always be subordinated to the direction of direction."</seg>
<seg id="520">"frequency dependencies Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD slides will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect, it has to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">"repetitions: specify how often the algorithm is going through. normally, here is 1 or 2."</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle increment da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be choosen too. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stepping width [0,1, 10]: integral stepping width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow it to be omitted."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of picture errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting picture errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and require a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove picture errors with small artefacts removed. the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"the radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can blurring the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to determine light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or smear occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: checks the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you cannot remove the entire noise or noise tips can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gameplay variance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more bolder than the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased to its minimum, noise and phase jitter appear on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crackle for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool for softener with the menu entry Corrigible softening and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; artifact-quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="561">"average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise blurring effects are caused by motion."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposures of today's film and color or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation with a center filter onto a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>

<seg id="580">"in general: this value controls the thickness of distortion second grade. with negative values, tonal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion can be corrected."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth grade. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value will scale the image size and will result in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog shows a preview of distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the tonne or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing changes. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonal correction, the effect would be apparent to the groove."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu or by removing the zoom controller of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motifs, like shots from the front, frame and paintings, is the perspective to correct all angles in the image 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>

<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IIR film. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image."</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter text applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digikam, filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver basins of the photoemulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film-basking effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy sight specifically in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film bastion effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed one (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural Images and Still Life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two regulators to influence this effect. the top elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large pictures. smooth checked the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage leaf. the lines that outline the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch yourself.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraver marks your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"the filter engravings is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, montane landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Invisible: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photograph taken from a car or train."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softener blurring: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Vibrating sharpness: blurred the image by random shift of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the image and blurring it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the picture into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation using the Beast button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses an algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">"droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image."</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can use the & digikam, image processing a range free of rain drops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter regentropfen the area will remain free of rain drops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right orientation by mirrors or turning."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you get the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation such as Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"preserve aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is placed, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarge Any input for photo can be saved as text file, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Beast button."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by adding a small image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo you just need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle as you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this allows you to change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply clicking the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button" "Ctrl + + X" "button in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save file under the File menu to save the newly-cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool Folder aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in portrait mode, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio cutting uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range to crop up to the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the mapping tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the help aid enable you to hide help, so that you can get your pictures together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elbows, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid guides when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you nearer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third-level rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also diverge from the golden spiral mentioned above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals to place on these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"when you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam, image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transforming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the presets button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have turned a picture, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transformer cutting from image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically crop function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smooths the image a bit after the rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you must use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>

<seg id="673">Angle to the upper right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double-strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with a transformation from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shift, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted in a parallelogram. you can start this module through Transformers scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using Horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"your help will display a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shearing, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shavings generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the shearing, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformers cropping out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digikam, requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats: JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: expect drapie not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter Window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now reset the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information from your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"the batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progressed."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, adding the & CD; adding titles to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudioCreator must be added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (assuming the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being inflicted on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, look in the source code....

<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before using the encoder. this is also necessary for pre-defined encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)." lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the spelling and read rights to it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument requires to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun shot (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here the term" "drum patch" "of the patch is meant, where each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum (as some keyboards have it)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboard maps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to map sounds on the percussion channel. look at the included Keyboards as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name Name is used for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events be multiplied by the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the Map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is a pitch Bender event, should play a sound higher with the value 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds higher up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. in the Settings menu, you will find the MIDI Settings menu."</seg>

<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in their distribution)."</seg>

<seg id="2047">"with regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -tag in the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"after creating the symbol, it must still be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK."</seg>

<seg id="2051">"suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus, functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I would like to have a quick access to the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"after new eXML does not exist, it will be stored in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its file list (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Section1.html Sections = Section1.html sec2.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the section & PHP; documentation like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently appears at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context sensitive help. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context-specific elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file by simply saving $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as sending DTD DTD package (DTEP) with Email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download it. the posts are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for a passphrase for your private gpg key (passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the dialogue New resource, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, even before the installation, examine & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signification. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with indicating the resource of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format might be necessary. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone, the & quantaplus, available. all that is selected as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; samples to toolbars with special actions specially designed for the files of a particular project. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, thus embedding the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please hit in, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with current document entries, such as closing the current, other, or all file fronts, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS instructions to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click on the editor area leads to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor."</seg>

<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white marks. later a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files while merging:"</seg>

<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a number of white signs you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differentiates itself in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are located in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by using only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop them: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, they in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>

<seg id="2499">"if you are suffering from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"to clarify it once again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that is caused by clicking the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"the intelligent shifting activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. the smart move requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly."</seg>

<seg id="2510">"if you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds."</seg>
<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you wish to use it again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"when your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball."</seg>

<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click. hereby, the status of & kmousetool will be reset and you can continue working as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location."</seg>
<seg id="2519">"solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but do not use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. safe zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows."</seg>

<seg id="2521">"the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to copy text, paste it into the clipboard, or use any other action, where you will probably need to move the mouse with pressed mouse button."</seg>

<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech-dispatcher program. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to choose correctly spoken words or abbreviations or to choose appropriate language and voice or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"to understand how filters work, it is important to know how the program" speech-dispatcher "works with a text. & ktons; distinguishes four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained jobs are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page can be read with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; -Notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. each order you receive from the card-card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no particular urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such read, this issue is stopped and ended."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -news."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replace replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktons; is provided with predefined string replacement filters that enable the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>

<seg id="2901">"a tape deck needs to be formatted before you can use it to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting & kdat; if your tape drive needs to be formatted before you use it, it needs to be formatted before you start formatting. floppy disk drives usually require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not."</seg>

<seg id="2903">"before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so-marked files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">"once the backup has been started, the dialog box opens. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu item Tested....</seg>
<seg id="2913">"once the test procedure has been started, the dialog box will appear for review. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"if you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"before you can initiate the restore, the files to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the menu.</seg>

<seg id="2920">"if you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the tape index file using the tape content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">"the current working folder, where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders that are listed under backup files, only the files located in it will be backed up to be stored on the same file system as the folder."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then."</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is included, the load is loaded to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"the option is turned on, tries & kdat; to lock the ejector in the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is enabled, the tape is discarded when loosening & kdat; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option for floppy extenders."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"the option is turned on, tries & kdat; the hardware-specific block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must communicate the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is the name: seconds, where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time when the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups."</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this icon is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems encountered on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single log lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open the system log, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion, or according to typed strings. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will display the entry. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter concept is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select a different entry at this point. for example, in the log file system protocol, select the process name, and then enter the name of a process in the log file system, and then you will show & ksystemlog; all log lines sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of level error are displayed with a more eye-catching color as log lines of the level indicator. the color display of log lines can be switched on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you only want to display a specific process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, when you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filtering tool."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the To-new lines option in the context menu of the main window to display all the new log lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log message from the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system quickly develops to the standard for controlling program start-up in the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I will not go further on historical aspects here (for example, because I don't know about it myself: -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to run when you start the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things like setserial, that is only started once. such calls are rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at various points after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and fix the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually run these scripts from hand to command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script is called stop using the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. I could also have a user -runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runlevels, or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this only happens when you extract an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new section. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the type number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting order numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore items thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice top- or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it to the clipboard with cut out (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. pre-settings are stored in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered from & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runlevels, and now the machine is constantly reaping. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the" "LILO -Prompt linux single" "and press the input button to start in the individual user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for executing under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution: please check, if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply exit without a message if their configuration files are not present or set up incorrectly."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that it can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser;"</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you must save them. either you will use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings. more flashcards appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the password management board appears, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card only appears if for at least one file system restricted (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space limitations are available in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the File System File System with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot from the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more."</seg>
