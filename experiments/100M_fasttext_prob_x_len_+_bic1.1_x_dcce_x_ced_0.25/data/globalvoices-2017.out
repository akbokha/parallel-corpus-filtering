&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only increased . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , its diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ election , was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ inate candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; nor was Tru@@ mp &apos;s world@@ view coinci@@ ded with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son . &quot;
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew leak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp made his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account by the hec@@ tic changes in their churches .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , have voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . Ü ) : as much as &quot; mut@@ iny of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the Great Van Jones called , has exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan whose history , as he himself says , would not be anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mps there is a huge part of the White American &apos;s promise , saying , &quot; Hell with diversity , freedom of religion , and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , has a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was rec@@ tified . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura have in common ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central concern for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its use of drugs and gangs of gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village situated practically at the top of As@@ unci@@ ón &apos;s largest garbage dump in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste materials : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin produced from apost@@ asy .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from re@@ manufactured material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
&quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already begun illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters , before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to take one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything &quot; , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at his time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was expelled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which cru@@ ises criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stopping Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries which then expelled the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand up for illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated per definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , actions nowadays occur in real time , trac@@ eable to the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal monster . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD against lost revenue that the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose every year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , species of protected species and fishes in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; You cannot run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly developed , helps to track the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , a NGO dealing with fisher@@ y data and providing technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , disable their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that links different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminals acting with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence this without a doubt the global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and Oce@@ ana &apos;s Oce@@ ana Marine Reserve : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of each individual trac@@ eable ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to fish without a licence , and hardly had to face any consequences , now know they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tra@@ iling nets that were banned . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the aim is to create even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela appear to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are seen as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the Pres@@ i@@ dency of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the opposition &apos;s proposal to a pro @-@ European referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ North @-@ located Bun@@ de@@ staat Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the office of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the Government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and monetary aggregates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on the country had the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to conclude a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which opposition parties and political groups were united , urged the demonstr@@ ators to continue on the 27th of October to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday a nationwide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; The Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ?

&quot; on Twitter there are pictures that tell about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which forms the scale of repression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for an administrative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado declare that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !

&quot; others regard these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from its point of view , under@@ took little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis , and preferred to c@@ ite critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 , Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis has no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ Government . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison until 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ us &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended you with an ERP . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t miss out on one day , and I &apos;ll have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s revolutionary workers &quot; party . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; he took me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ps of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were par@@ ked and held me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I came in , and saw a couch where man was tortured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was tied up there .
&quot; they seldom captiv@@ ate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... as a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can so much harm another ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay with the face down@@ wards - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people kept cau@@ ti@@ ously on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you come up with me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed a man .
&quot; ( according to survivors of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war @-@ prey are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military @-@ bad@@ ges , which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als it , then it &apos;s not war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who stal@@ ked the cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time the defense , a con@@ spir@@ ator accused me of being in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed men during the dictatorship , but why did the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why kidn@@ ap children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they would have been able to put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but of course , anything remains . &quot;
I saw how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of his atro@@ cities .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt alien@@ ated and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; that allegedly defended them were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and forced me as a child to take part in this .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Please forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I created the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel . &quot;
&quot; Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la , together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 . &quot;
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for justice for the victims for years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial was erected there , which is now run by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation mistake makes elderly people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

the photo was spread in the social media .
edit the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , last month witnesses of a particularly un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word was discovered on a sign , the &quot; &quot; older car &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; older car &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with vi@@ cious back @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also interested in the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ appearing daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; says Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News has dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 out of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the published version of the article , the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So bad the translation is actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , which might translate into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign employees can produce translations in the company . then , the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; translations are also widespread , often with funny results . &quot;
&quot; the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , created by machine translations , show that this technology can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; home page &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers were also transmitting recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ net page .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the commission for telecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at it as a &quot; call to force . &quot; &quot;
without cable television and informative national TV channels I have registered for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds fla@@ wed or refuses to request such an Internet site . &quot;
&quot; we acknowledge a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was hired on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was detained . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to receive training &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a son of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house , where she worked for years . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ine , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 girls and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children will have to pay for innumerable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abol@@ ished . &quot;
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that is inj@@ ected to the cri@@ mp is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that takes up their daughter in the belief that they are able to complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn from it until many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , was seen as a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the home of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela held the crimes committed deeply in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; without official papers , it is much easier to violate the rights of children un@@ punished . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ mean
&quot; the cri@@ tiz@@ ers are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt and her father lost his work . &quot;
her brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ min@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that she was still time to learn . &quot;
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , she clean@@ sed the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but she also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand beside him and read editorial from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he held it intellig@@ ently , but did not stop with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared they would lose the education they had made possible , they explained . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ mp . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;

the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the country inside who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the writers ad the ad once more :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was complete .

&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , and the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were forced to go into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and this to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; sixty @-@ five Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to adopt a draft law on &quot; &quot; regulating the use and utilisation of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register to a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the draft law , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . it is also unclear how the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook . due to which , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but until now it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techni@@ cian ( in German &quot; managing researcher &quot; ) at the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forci@@ bly physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will establish a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to supply them to a court case . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ y@@ haw@@ y proposed a criminal off@@ ence against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those accused of threatening &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation &quot; &quot; Iraq &quot; &quot; work to protect the hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a large predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to actually see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a enjoys a passion for a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;

&quot; early March 2017 documented the progress made for Nor@@ theast Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years to re@@ construct the lives of those affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold catastrophe &quot; in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , experiencing both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring countries of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture saw a nuclear accident , and 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Special Report shows what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the lives of the local residents . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed ( for example , the &quot; &quot; Fl@@ y@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ g@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; pre@@ f@@ ecture ) in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light of 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by government establishments ( to be called &quot; &quot; Kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) , they are still trying to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , who lived after the disaster in homes , were moved to final homes . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by disaster , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours are now in operation in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have largely affected agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers since the catastrophe find it difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
in her introduction to the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung comments :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .

how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the end of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive building projects . these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one connects more than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , let &apos;s look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat themes that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music contributed to the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer accused him of a march against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; doctors operated him this Saturday , and now they put him into an artificial coma . &quot;
its condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures you can see the face of the police officer with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás conf@@ essed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the examination of the incident from the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the web where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10.000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he was accused of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil that last Friday suffered brutal police attacks against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; police officers were in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported by a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their front pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a burned @-@ in bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic ground , more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular Fel@@ low Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who w@@ akes up every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long time of in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago , the message would have been a motive for concern for the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and they were hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ spec@@ tions &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations agricultural and nutrition organisation . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s Day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; the following years saw a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only from the parts that would be removed , ad@@ ress and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
from then on the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters came more and more frequently .
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still under operation , &quot; he asser@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producer was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president was looking into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to gr@@ ind them , they also stopped to gr@@ asp@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people suddenly left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ os per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , nevertheless he does not forgive the lies they told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement for 65 years , not because he lacks strength , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; the workshop thus increases the fact that the young participants in talks hold topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen young women mostly disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
most of the cases have not been elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people were not always able to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will receive our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and go forward as well as our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do what the Creator has ordained for them . &quot;
in the commentary piece the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ verb@@ ank ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( sprin@@ kled , sprin@@ kled ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are displayed near the entrance of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce exactly those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his movie Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic bags as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji To@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new Boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for your mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers will allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon ? . &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , and by , you will be able to find out . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the city district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a case , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every corp@@ se , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project in this way :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my Father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where shall we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; Y@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been aware of illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I pass to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone , and those who fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ ber . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not move and stand still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family with threats had been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in that , it describes how armed criminals comp@@ eted money from their business for month , until they had destroyed not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fer@@ ment potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and that he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had passed two years before , when he only had a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the council of public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8,5 mur@@ ders a day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot;
when an image is worth a thousand words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he is linked contains pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to picture trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false pairing between picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , dump@@ ed around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
&quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; vom Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ med bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but history does not end here .
&quot; over the years the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one was left to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only by means of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be pic@@ tori@@ ally displayed .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Niger and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ interpretations ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly fal@@ sely affect the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash@@ light , published by the United Nations , those who could escape blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said , monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to picture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but did not have the image associated with the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the aforementioned picture of the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed screen of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , some others have tried to un@@ mask the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which they have been published . by doing so , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be completely depl@@ eted ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available via the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also show fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , clearly have not seen sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one T@@ we@@ et expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a right to judge what they considered &quot; intentionally obsc@@ ured news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judging , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to bog@@ us images of sc@@ ents that run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and be used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( what is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo will NOT show Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news site mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the image continues to be included at the time of this publication .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ olische Ker@@ ch An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the El Pa@@ is newspaper attempted to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo mer@@ ges , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam . &quot;
USA 2015 .
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and rescu@@ ed more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , they translated the discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message . &quot;
&quot; from the message containing the image from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ers missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos isolated themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; ink Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in Gra@@ u ) but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original report of 2010 , the picture eventually carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ me@@ works ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued as compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of thousands who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal is equal to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there is concern that violent images des@@ en@@ si@@ tise readers and viewers and take them the ability to perceive emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent depic@@ tions in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will need to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but it can also be detached from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
&quot; these words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the tax @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - Study about your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved around you in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal different thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; &quot; uns@@ ur@@ passed &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; speakers , highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite ones . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally begins at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the shore . &quot;
&quot; after a statement from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka dated May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ding and mud wave . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe places of residence . &quot;
the rainf@@ alls spread on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning .
health and hygiene conditions are a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the yesterday over@@ worn water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants of their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and food for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ at@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
&quot; the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the disaster centre is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button allowing users to call up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people with high water and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and help aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we will channel rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , tied from an American flag , others sc@@ aff@@ old slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they em@@ body me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , will be reli@@ eved . &quot;
ab@@ domin@@ als are becoming ab@@ norm@@ alized
I &apos;m not alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you get in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace of mind ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , religion was deleted by Rum@@ i , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been col@@ oni@@ alizing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ ed the story behind these images . &quot;
but these images still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that , over the past three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it cle@@ ars the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we are also creating narr@@ atives which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims face the highest &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ stem@@ med Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan had re@@ considered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were free Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and American woman ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I j@@ okes , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of exceptional Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight far @-@ spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ di@@ ality machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information , which our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the kind we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who is tear@@ ing down the head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior , and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslim if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I sat in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to the protection of the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters eventually posed in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how they gain a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means speaking the prayers she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who , for centuries , was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire &quot; that founded a company with the name of Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ uni @-@ Company , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cried to his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close to his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslim is to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colonial &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was thrown off over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ seen history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , who were scattered across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy reaches the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago , the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a fre@@ eing black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that a hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it &apos;s the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ woman , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means to fail to communicate the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a cube of magic , but it is represented in the reducing two &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration li@@ aison officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; that largely focuses on Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we cast down to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically wrong image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply inclined to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades , to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous image prints that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , a Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned with this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , they had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but they made me an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread crust in my speech .
&quot; things that may evoke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity constitutes , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Berkeley bridge , conversations will take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not concepts we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I talking about this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars and people were led through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , was even scientific by Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already sh@@ outs broken lands and &quot; &quot; other man @-@ made &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the counting of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the unmistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are located in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , embrace diversity - secure rooms where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with understanding , these events are rather &quot; listening &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to soci@@ alize . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers face and translate their story in their own language first and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the audience . &quot;
they call forth laugh@@ ing and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the fa@@ bel of rab@@ bits and b@@ abo@@ ons in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; &quot; how is that to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; with a broad smile he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS to organise their own story@@ telling . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re@@ establish sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march began with the Republi@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishment of debts have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities responsible for debts will be held ac@@ countable for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt which is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures to be imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens risk being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration was called &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and family members continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and freely available here , contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real cost is to which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information on its current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed her of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; however , its location and state remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ tille &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything on it , to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ am but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners , read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology for me . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is roy@@ alty @-@ free .
cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your ad@@ orable eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I put in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; I have a passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el :
&quot; one year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release on previous post
&quot; with anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on corruption . &quot;
&quot; this is the de@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za that was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison , together with four other defend@@ ants , with 54 million Me@@ ti@@ als ( approximately 800@@ ,000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council appointed Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who evaluated the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , since the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants don &apos;t like the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note of is that the company should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the wrong@@ doing .
&quot; the company , however , seemed to be silent and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had eaten . &quot;
&quot; he could hold affordable lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to return to serve the state , but has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state when it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora mach@@ el prison , and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of everything , including the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or fis@@ sur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net as they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Fl@@ oral &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dero@@ g@@ atory con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with very different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like this :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question face ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analy@@ tic before removing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjoining words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new fac@@ ebook of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to distribute , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community Standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook has more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a large turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts without hate speech , but have been removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to encourage violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure , the balancing hate speech on its bur@@ ge@@ al sides . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided to adopt a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the marriage there were some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a large public scre@@ am . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ch Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere with the fact that age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner to the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which endea@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for child marriage , followed at the base and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the child , they should , do@@ omed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the child &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be proclaimed .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one against it .
&quot; having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws for chil@@ dr@@ ens had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ ing News ! &quot;
the marriage network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the design for the change of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
the child marriage is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ like ag@@ ei@@ dium abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj ple@@ dged his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed and he seems to redeem his promise now . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the subject in a different way . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; sat instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters from being mis@@ used , would be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children in different gra@@ dations are legal or still the norm , although there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

&quot; through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share useful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using re@@ taining dies for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet took place since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several error pages ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now sur@@ faced . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform depen@@ ded on all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content can be retri@@ ev@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; having heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on it to map snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed fashion . &quot;
this can help users to at least look at all Wikipedia sites even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the block@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a ma@@ go site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors , if banned in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as employee at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one acc@@ esses another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
because this is done by a server which is not in Turkey .

this motivated him to carry a camera with himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that attract attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this top @-@ class location helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , because he had already conf@@ essed to Tig@@ ers face to face , &quot;
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he sat down immediately , we looked at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ck@@ a and initially appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women with great care avoid speaking the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a pseudo court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also not to be called by the name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer warran@@ ties to fear if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al Campa@@ ign , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ese has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as child marriage , to exile from HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was of women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to speak lou@@ dly the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all hold up to and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not consider this , is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ oli of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women should never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only gi@@ g@@ gling before her during the whole exercise , and another decided to release the entire frustr@@ ated frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it before the whole family at dinner .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was frigh@@ tened and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he did it too . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , for the first time in their lives , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ist Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they haven &apos;t dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
&quot; the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only when they are alone and are no other members of the family . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ tan on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
every one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29 of this year , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; ( The Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) was held in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese drift through . &quot;
people here have become quite quickly aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ trade , probably for non @-@ believers purposes , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they were allowed to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Mozambique in Mozambique are the goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Muslim police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bon@@ e in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in stri@@ fe , according to which the victims were in the head of power generating wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha said on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like to go to E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams a country in which people would have shame to go on the road , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which men would not hurt or even take their lives to gain their own bread , a country in which people would not be hur@@ ried or even bald for non @-@ religious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the chance of mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ched that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both sli@@ pper@@ y : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of the people of some people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox und Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ tille &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she had been contacted by the members of the Assad government . &quot;
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but gave no further information .
&quot; Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a learned about Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we show the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the Open web movement . &quot;
and we honor the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , including the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested or enforced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ ther Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us Fall as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and says a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to release appeals from the international community , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government stated that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trips to China since the exports were mostly blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she announced in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him the opportunity to treat abroad so far as he could help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was born on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns as to whether the whi@@ rl@@ wind could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and the United Kingdom
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ P previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the rights to exercise these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; in a statement on 29 June , China called on the Foreign Affairs Ministry to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where necessary . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ lords in Taiwan asked China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on June 28 about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ dis@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who preten@@ ding to be demo@@ crats , leaving the distorted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ responses to his American guests regarding our press , our syndic@@ ative , our political system . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised such questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng is calling for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our little K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should begin reading the entire address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why Singapore elections were so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - either I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , really associates and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ assem@@ bles the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally country and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ dis@@ gam &apos;s statements are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , do they only defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who does our prime minister need to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home country or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question asked most of me in Japan is , &quot; Are you Americans ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I will answer . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly in front of anger if they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposedly also considered to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , if you would like to switch to Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be fun - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has their own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have any personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main property of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence around the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau considered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ zes the jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civil government , continues to dominate the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what prescri@@ p@@ tions he makes to his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video relates indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political issues that have persi@@ sted in Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; setting up &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor the online content and prosec@@ ute people accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict end against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black vans before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will face long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ anarch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sign@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Central Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here ; today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ han@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ uch@@ adne@@ zzar , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings have fallen into decay and rarely are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is still unique . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all served by the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ u@@ z@@ ho@@ v@@ kas , which still have one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , two years old , look out of the window of a ruined house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ han@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ ji@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave off Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s meeting partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day it reminds itself of the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; for each child , Nat@@ asha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money . &quot;
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once stood , they keep pigs , cows , rab@@ bits and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
it tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and war were once .
&quot; when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide for in@@ security in their lives . &quot;
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 @-@ year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in the ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez talks , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the top of the coast they begin to cry out , &quot; M@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
she does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ ghurt beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they went on to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valencia and its family recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , the travelers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones calm@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she leaves with numerous photos in her album .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ spots , who have made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats each time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , in the course of the &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of U@@ rum@@ qi received a phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
the message is said to prevent the app from getting access to terrorist information .
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ Lang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with min@@ ors for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports of digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , displaced ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit tur@@ mo@@ il and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict zones , the authorities often arrange extreme procedures and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published on Twitter , featured photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( in the course of the process ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and organisations connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; Freedom House &apos;s current report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; by the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible crime rates , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death : part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &apos; sleep or death &apos; , in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one who has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , beautiful scenes and actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth is on the axis of the Un@@ holy . you realise that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to allow me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; cries . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands placed on a city that is plu@@ gged into the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had a little cal@@ med down , after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined to a magnificent picture that fulfilled my expectations completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice back after you have scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father , equal to that . &quot;
&quot; his father , just like that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I mar@@ ched through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
&quot; after that , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I remember all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; differently than usual , this time they have given me a bigger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoner , and I must immediately sit without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I resor@@ ted to a tried and tested method of communication : hitting the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; first @-@ chief . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a well @-@ known middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no striking features can be recognized on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers . &quot;
perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately interro@@ gate .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him , if I remain . &quot;
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that cle@@ ave to the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us with horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13th Sh@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security from us and prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye field of their world view . &quot;
there is no house here that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
&quot; I enter the interro@@ gation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that tell him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to deserve this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cries . &quot;
&quot; my cries were still not enough , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a refuse collector or whether it belonged to the standard equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I ceased to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no favor , why he resor@@ ted to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be still , and stay away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he nar@@ rows to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine to discover .
&quot; he lives in the top storey of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned their tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who seek to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian leader of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances so , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the slots speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the vou@@ chers of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink water in public during Ram@@ adan , in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual woman Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the well @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continued to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simple rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional sex marri@@ ages by den@@ oun@@ cing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ tro@@ dden woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women , who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; honorary posts &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is even more difficult to support Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release there is often a long @-@ term bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to do not shy away from issues , which in his country have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but does not dream of separating his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was told politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are political in the heart , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - either faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and his opinion was cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; You@@ tube was uploaded without cuts , but only one edited version was stre@@ amed , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly campaigns for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , advoc@@ ating that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ de , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite realm , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they had critic@@ ised the problems in social media , which were related to the deeply rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , reas@@ oned and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will become closer to a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until this time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ u in August . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years ago in order to force the Indi@@ genous people of the region , the em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid trol@@ leys are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and personal hygiene were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where traffic rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drugs are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the dres@@ sage competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( there are more videos on current cont@@ ests on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ ser art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities that are offering , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question that the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , inspired her to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la V@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters for Recon@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos for his mer@@ its received the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; but before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to a war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , now have to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more urgently . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most pressing response . &quot;
&quot; thus arose the plan to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I would never have thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were delivered to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bri@@ ls &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote to me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; &quot; suddenly , tears flow@@ ed over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net designers .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , he was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already a war , and the F@@ ARC were already in hiding . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have explained the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never been hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that those people I often had seen as monsters and even hated , were also only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much harm to teach us something and give a smile and hu@@ g .
many former milit@@ ants responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian people were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to take up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now relying on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there was not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what happened in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she shed light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ ine , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she sen@@ sed that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she ultimately moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was just taking a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two pun@@ ches in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances were you put in , in which of the men or women ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated but my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and took me to the women .
for that I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having handled respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once talked about my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has corrupted not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she laid a rope around her neck . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without registration , without ID , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived at and check@@ ered to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;d be security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you plug in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender balance , that is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually try to look at how the person looks like she looks out of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
&quot; for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with it I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end ask for evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , took place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the seri@@ ousness !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; originally , but at the end it was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes and wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and shorts .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never insul@@ ted me .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; gr@@ otto not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said about children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never offen@@ ded me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel the people in the city started to change . &quot;
those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
&quot; in that time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : which activity do you now go to ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t give a cent for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ ate Zu@@ gli@@ ort .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is good .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as cher@@ ries who want to make you white with foam before the mouth , that there are no bo@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ers who have the cab@@ in@@ ers who have the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s uncomfortable to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in su@@ ici@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in su@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he felt ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab An@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 it made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields present in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the native population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of spon@@ ges that diver@@ ge water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Economic Co @-@ operation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who had a job were completed , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have university degrees . &quot;
a systematic strategy aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the mind of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans , newly emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aiming to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their home country . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm warns before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is an revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminine in general .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men nowadays . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used by racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin colour equal rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized entity in a historic sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to dissolve myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( such as : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) , says that we can defend ourselves by being fully secure and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , corpor@@ al and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern from the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a Police In@@ spec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ iting partner who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman appeared to Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman left her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must first report to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; 1 . pun@@ ches and statistics 2 Un@@ seen abuse and a judicial system , which is nothing inferior to 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to find out how many women really are mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are several reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements by the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the Peace Cour@@ ts . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here . &quot;
&quot; in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ stries Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women are coming who do not . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which does not under@@ mine anything &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . however , for two years she endu@@ red the mental violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier , I always thought that only women who are sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two years relationship , explaining how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
finally her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach and lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of mal@@ treatment is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prin@@ Sie ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ini@@ d is to declare a self @-@ employed crime and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; so the law text was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which are in principle forbidden in Paraguay and can be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original draft bill envis@@ aged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to carry on themselves , if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence can no longer be regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get away . &quot;
we must report as long an ad until ill treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the Recon@@ ci@@ liation Section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities concluded the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving an annual prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after killing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : prime minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council on Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ans &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially of domestic secret services , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and in@@ timi@@ dating human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict and prevent legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of justice &quot; was published . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused officials of the Supreme Court judge in Oman to uph@@ old a ruling in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS @-@ based editor @-@ in @-@ chief , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor for al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the information minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ha@@ j took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of each 3000 om@@ ani@@ ac ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material which could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a b@@ ail was set in the amount of 5000 Alban@@ ian Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released from prison on 10 April 2017 , following the closing of his six @-@ month prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he served his annual prison sentence . &quot;
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court of Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was injured in Oman in recent times .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closing of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continued closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Cuban authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to : &quot;
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their lawful human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial sp@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , mapping takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : on the one hand there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have grave rami@@ fications in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investment in the research of these diseases by the phar@@ ma companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself investigated the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian Medical System . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier referred to as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I am preparing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
Q : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a creator . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
Q : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are subsidi@@ zed differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
Q : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
Q : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , beginning at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vis @-@ à @-@ vis Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines only make articles available against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of salad it can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
&quot; patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been filed to more and more plants such as grain and cart@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on is still breeding a salad , but it takes longer , since his work is more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river , around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and all over the world : open source breeding ( open source breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have cul@@ tured and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ sh@@ ouse species in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

&quot; it is not by chance that this name sounds like this , as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot;
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si in short , US breeders can commit that other seeds can be freely used by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seed to breed their own varieties , and not immediately to sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ted professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed remains freely available to others , as opposed to patent seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is increasingly un@@ restricted .
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is declining through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property en@@ clos@@ ets other breeders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees it different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ander , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long to grow crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who breeds a variety breeds its own values in it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , who breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly contrary . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most small seed companies even without surviving patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his vegetable garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; for 20 years I have been protected from competition with a patent . &quot;
&quot; although the United States seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ és is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should be the official starting signal for the scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context , by Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon recognise him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly focused on where and how it is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisations and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained loyal to its goal , to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to uph@@ old freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months ago , such as the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles which he writes for websites and media not accessible to Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider who is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him : &quot;
&quot; locking the blogs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ wa al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; I succeeded in transmitting the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blogs and any other website I worked for . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to deal with cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24th May to 0@@ 6th August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
A@@ af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter contents on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is additionally worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; newspapers printed all over Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Ser@@ ebe rough@@ ed the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air lake to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio de Janeiro , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t even know the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the cru@@ el@@ ty of the police , which first shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; ar@@ gues . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ bog@@ gling neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; reminder : Rio de Janeiro , the state of Rio de Janeiro , is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia puts emphasis on , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit arrested by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police commission and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several reports on har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which the newly created police unit should actually protect , it became increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state to use resources and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; where a civilian is an im@@ pass@@ able point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week that the police succ@@ um@@ b to the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; to stay alive : learn besieg@@ ed Syrians , plant mushrooms &quot;
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal repression and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to the World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organisation and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; particularly strongly affected is the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , which led people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smu@@ g@@ gled foodstuffs . &quot;
&quot; due to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the diver@@ t of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been campaig@@ ning for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now gaining popularity . &quot;
&quot; in order to raise money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do can be used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ as . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ation of fung@@ i , according to Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will still be collecting donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 4 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ us seeds coming from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; after that they planted a small mushroom farm in a pan . as this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break@@ age of the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible .
we want our experience to inspire people in conflict areas and help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; several hundred people were prot@@ esting in many capital cities in Portugal on October 21 , demanding justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led the government to cry out for the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery in 2017 alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon neighborhood . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

the predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did not do this on Sunday : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the case of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for forestry that the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was rejected by the municipalities , which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ ren@@ to continues in the same article in the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from slightly inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems are added to the fact that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot;

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say so , she knew that she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break . &quot;
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara feel defen@@ cel@@ ess suddenly . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of Haz@@ ara , came ever closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at the time , as today , Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so we wouldn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous journey on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island . &quot;
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy women twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for expi@@ red asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers are finding in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it took A@@ shar@@ af too .
but his un@@ b@@ anded li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant ori@@ ent Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp Restaurant in Pad@@ ua . Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s objectives are far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim to return to the country he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also designs plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and training techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill for shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in custody for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency .
&quot; in order to be able to use the social networks , users would need to register within six months of submitting legislation to the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or the final payment of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament presented a legislative proposal that would introduce tough@@ er sanctions for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , however , such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , such as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would substanti@@ ate a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators fighting against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened by the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , charges of weapons , including weapons of arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza opened the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists with un@@ le@@ aked documents
&quot; in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; the plan stems from the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial bill of law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ lawful funds . &quot;
&quot; this document , published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared as a witness at the District Court in Tunis on 9 May . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their passport ?
&quot; according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
in the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved within the social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
will we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register itself as &quot; Organ@@ izer of Information Distribution &quot; at the provincial government . &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ it@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has lock Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it became &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is therefore , among others , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop cutting down
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance authorities that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and de@@ cryp@@ t the data encryption programs . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
