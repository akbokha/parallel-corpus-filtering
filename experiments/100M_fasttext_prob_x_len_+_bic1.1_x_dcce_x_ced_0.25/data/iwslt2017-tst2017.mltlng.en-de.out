this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed down dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the blu@@ ep@@ rint of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving up .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going to jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though , for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to aw@@ nings . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can always be less hidden .
&quot; instead of having to fail and raise money for asser@@ tion , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without their consent , kept secret their telep@@ hon@@ y proof , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit return , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they receive contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet existed when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source inter@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; you can upload documents or send information there , just like any common contact form . &quot;
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer provide information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies which je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology designers like Edward Snow@@ den have the option of bringing iniquity . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
or the next environmental employee who warns against the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest install@@ ment of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the plot of an agent collector or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go on that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conc@@ eal their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be confusing this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fas@@ hen . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that in the USA there are less reports of this matter .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans , who came in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attorney firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules of the game . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very melanch@@ oly as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing could have changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen suggestions towards more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the topic found political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA left behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress which we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms .
we need leaders in the economy that get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparency that now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I took a back yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said that he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really wants that . I don &apos;t want to land ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get into it ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aking at the door of the door and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came into play .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; we would like to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; through the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
&quot; however , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business , which allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you can feel now -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that &apos;s more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can read not only their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gore &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is dedicated to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have presented himself with his name only once , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 convic@@ tions that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well sprung cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
&quot; for a well thought out feedback system , trust is crucial . &quot;
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests gave their assessments , before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence . &quot;
little surprise we trust people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it &apos;s exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through judgments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from similarities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when you talk too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can we create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people , who were more than willing to put aside these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to party or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million medi@@ ated nights had ever been a problem . &quot;
for men trust each other rightly .
&quot; if trust works , there can be mira@@ culous results . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
they leave an even longer stay without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; but now simply call the &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at every place one visits , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show a district where one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn to cook a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the thought of sharing common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
are now available to residents . students looking for a place to stay
&quot; were given to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality already existed before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I made the decision to ou@@ ten myself .
&quot; no , not as a gay man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence vis @-@ à @-@ vis the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only pas@@ sively accept the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you fully , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
that is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock quickly turned into revolt .
why should I do that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; sm@@ ashed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying , &quot; &quot; Watch carefully , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mo@@ urn . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on that first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims and struck them free . &quot;
there were really fire stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have put the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly tell yourself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and make mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; it might be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
a regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerance of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and like me , a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; as a first person , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may be bra@@ in@@ washed , and anyone who ab@@ hor@@ ts their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or denied by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her rage , she was a major objective for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
she learned what she learned in the mosque to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit to test persons messages reported negative about Muslims , they are more likely to agree with military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you are looking at the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was astonished and said :
&quot; when is such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to go to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I have collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker who are working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is to become a billion dollar business , just before . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air delivery has penet@@ rated into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by joining together , air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most starter motors , it can float , and has major advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ edge star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flying device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which gather together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying is working with only one . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no flap , hing@@ es and ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or controller interfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly horizont@@ ally and move across the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the odds of throwing it right , if all watch me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the Extra@@ ordinary Ab@@ ility , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some models are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at it .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or one battery -- the machine can continue to fly , if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages lies in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far away gal@@ axy ; they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this brief moment , it sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; their energy , however , did not set them free in form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events initially .
3 billion years ago there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which occur approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ cked through the earth through the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my sick father .
&quot; in essence , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observ@@ atories as Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ dle in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
lec@@ turers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to correctly al@@ ber@@ ed dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ oned by us when the waves arrived . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o staff explained for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; as Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are huge . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
this is quite convenient . for this is how you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light around you coming from several points .
&quot; with sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now just Alice is talking .
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; shower Bob , Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circuit with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement , embos@@ sed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; somebody who knows what to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing the way for the exploration of the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
many things in space -- practically or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because they are op@@ aque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own rear light . &quot;
by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o Project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring forth black holes , like Lig@@ o watch them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . black holes , so to speak , are the sour no@@ d@@ ules for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , wo@@ unding my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed . &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ sau@@ cer . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes .
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things look , bring you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
&quot; each program offers hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days at four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
$ 350 million for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening consec@@ u@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs I have created myself and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who else is doing that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are leading a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just look around on the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true , when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t work with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is as if I set up troops , when I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one toler@@ ates a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums , that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working and working and working and working , creating , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive other than by size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to look different than by size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called Sum@@ men .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things are at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom@@ my is a single work institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my M@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ country . &quot;
they are the children of a tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the sum did not return .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Look out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you do what you are doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you already knew the sums , who is you ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sw@@ um bet@@ ook , and everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of bo@@ asting , I cannot do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to release , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the sums of titles , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on the love .
the sums are the current coming from the lust of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums are simple and original .
&quot; true sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as easy as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at work at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be more than home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I must have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them . &quot;
&quot; we ra@@ vel in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; in doing so I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fulfilled me . &quot;
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dream .
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie will replace me .
&quot; and my teen@@ age daughter talks to me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more is not required . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy .
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the track , why don &apos;t you treat yourself to a full 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
&quot; the sums came back in my spare time , and the sums seem to return when I &apos;m not working . &quot;
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers ; dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the Sum@@ m@@ ary of Life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but just one part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the sums , the sums , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new attitude towards life is wide in me . less titanium - more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things look , I &apos;ll get you to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for our neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in this case , one im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
&quot; it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain . &quot;
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you must imagine that the brain sw@@ ells up with skull @-@ brain trauma and cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save lives , the pressure of the skull must be reduced . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes has to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece is similar to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you need to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed it . &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
you may know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they preserved ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear however -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we took the opportunity to re @-@ enter it at the outlet point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- car transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we take the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ under@@ ed .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets from a tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the manual motor area . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now you can see , when we have re@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate it to humans .
I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Luigi Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you need to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting the TED and telling us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it really is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy winds its way with us in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mis@@ erable , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are aver@@ ted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , which however are too sc@@ ary to invest it there where it could be productive and income , with which one could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , England and the Eurozone , $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion has been invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time runs around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock markets and adverti@@ se real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops , which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the U.S. , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low total economic demand , which , as in a final loop , is feared by the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would be true that his son would kill him when he becomes mature , &quot;
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances that cause Ö@@ di@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all this un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and naturally slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy as a result of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the toil@@ ing poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote wei@@ ghting in matters of the state prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually shifted politics and escap@@ es them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because the government can now be in the government , and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed , that they end up star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised policy so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ tops , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ crats &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts more deeply , just as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and take care that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which the human society is in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in all bre@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or surplus of the respective country , into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it favor@@ s privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Luigi Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you aren &apos;t confused , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the Western point of view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- a fully democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to reproach China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent denial that a massive de@@ fle@@ ction line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal - by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to deny the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Troika &apos;s credi@@ tors imposed on this policy said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake .
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we furn@@ ish ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it seems to me it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ dres@@ ser and refers to Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to choose the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where after you have looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not concerned about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean em@@ ulation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he &apos;s really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something so , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he stops a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes up many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon publishes things for nothing , one acc@@ esses , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts are ski@@ pped or watched again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people don &apos;t remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 , i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows whose course they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so it &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a dis@@ mis@@ sal occurs . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict erup@@ tions of flu , the bad way , through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly need to do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do it several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for that and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that wasn &apos;t in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data says . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will test it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have heard in hind@@ sight to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not alter the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing , and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
