<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed down drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if this sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the blueprint of the government to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving up.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though, for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to awnings."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can always be less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of having to fail and raise money for assertion, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without their consent, kept secret their telephony proof,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit return, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they receive contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source intermittance system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can upload documents or send information there, just like any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer provide information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments all over the world are developing new spying technologies which jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology designers like Edward Snowden have the option of bringing iniquity. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental employee who warns against the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016 the largest installment of the story was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain a statement.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is alleged that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent collector or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go on that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fashen."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that in the USA there are less reports of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans, who came in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, through the principle that these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 attorney firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we must change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very melancholy as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing could have changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen suggestions towards more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA left behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress which we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally finish the intransparency that now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design studies, I took a back yard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said that he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really wants that. I don't want to land abducted in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said:" "uh, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get into it?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaking at the door of the door and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure that our cheese-ham-Omelts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into play.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we would like to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"through the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"however, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business, which allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you can feel now -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that's more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can read not only their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gore's cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is dedicated to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have presented himself with his name only once, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 convictions that all say: "he can really capture very well sprung cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"for a well thought out feedback system, trust is crucial."</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests gave their assessments, before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It's exciting to add a person's call -- in our case through judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when you talk too little, such as" Hi!, "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimum degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle works of art in your home! I'm doing vacation with my family." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not reckon was the large amount of people, who were more than willing to put aside these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to party or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million mediated nights had ever been a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, there can be miraculous results."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave an even longer stay without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply call the" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at every place one visits, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show a district where one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the thought of sharing common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relations, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Are now available to residents. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I made the decision to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a gay man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," "Why do you oppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist Declaration of Independence vis-à-vis the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, understands you fully, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical failure?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into revolt.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... "..." in the name of Islam... ""... "" jihad... "," "..." smashed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying," "Watch carefully," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't mourn."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims congregate for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "don't go on that first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims and struck them free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire stops on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have put the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly tell yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually say people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and make mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it might be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">A regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerance of people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me, a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"as a first person, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists may be brainwashed, and anyone who abhorts their behavior and ideology is a traitor or denied by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her rage, she was a major objective for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">She learned what she learned in the mosque to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit to test persons messages reported negative about Muslims, they are more likely to agree with military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you are looking at the mood against Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assigning collective innocence, it is not just about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental Faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such an accomplished young man out of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what you say to those who might say you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinker who are working in a noble thought factory, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>

<seg id="402">"when you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things."</seg>
<seg id="403">"they want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace."</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for hobbyists is to become a billion dollar business, just before."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air delivery has penetrated into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1,500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by joining together, air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must be aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level, e. g." "Start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starter motors, it can float, and has major advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedge starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flying device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, which gather together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying is working with only one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flap, hinges and rudder, no further actuators or controller interfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly horizontally and move across the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the odds of throwing it right, if all watch me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the Extraordinary Ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some models are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or one battery -- the machine can continue to fly, if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, wages lies in the development and the creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far away galaxy; they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this brief moment, it shone brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">"their energy, however, did not set them free in form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events initially.</seg>
<seg id="476">3 billion years ago there was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which occur approximately through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer-gravitational-waves-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves rocked through the earth through the two colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories as Ligo. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cradle in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses on relativity theory often lead to correctly albered dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched and stoned by us when the waves arrived. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, the Ligo staff explained for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than one thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"as Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for this is how you can make a picture or a map of things by seeing the light around you coming from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">"with sounds, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice is talking.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"shower Bob, Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulate simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circuit with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement, embossed in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] somebody who knows what to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving the way for the exploration of the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many things in space -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is covered by its own rear light."</seg>
<seg id="541">By means of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo Project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring forth black holes, like Ligo watch them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. black holes, so to speak, are the sour nodules for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I experimented with an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year I would say" "yes" "to everything I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, wounding my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-saucer."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes.</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swore to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things look, bring you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each program offers hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days at four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, four episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run on Thursday evening consecutively."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs I have created myself and not only produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are leading a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I don't just look around on the computer and fancier, and it's true, when I say: I understand that it doesn't work with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I set up troops, when I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, one tolerates a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums, that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working and working and working and working, creating, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can't strive other than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being able to look different than by size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I know only that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things are at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overdone, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mommy is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my Mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Look out, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you do what you are doing, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives you the buzz when you already knew the sums, who is you?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," "Mum, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "kitten." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my swum betook, and everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you like playing?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of boasting, I cannot do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to release, or whatever the girl gets in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the sums of titles, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums are the current coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"true sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be more than home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of them."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we ravel in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naïve for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and my teenage daughter talks to me for a whole 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more is not required."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy.</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and I'll win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the track, why don't you treat yourself to a full 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">"the sums came back in my spare time, and the sums seem to return when I'm not working."</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers; dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summary of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of work is part of me, but just one part. and for that I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the sums, the sums, the other, the right humming: the sum of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new attitude towards life is wide in me. less titanium - more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this humming, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I'm a writer. I think things look, I'll get you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for our neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the best-known, the" deep-brain stimulation. "in this case, one implantiates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">"it is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe trembling and severe pain."</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that the brain swells up with skull-brain trauma and cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save lives, the pressure of the skull must be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes has to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece is similar to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you need to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed it."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">You may know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in exactly the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we took the opportunity to re-enter it at the outlet point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we take the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been plundered.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured in the motor cortex the manual motor area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now you can see, when we have replanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implantiate it to humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Luigi Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you need to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting the TED and telling us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it really is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy winds its way with us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are miserable, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are averted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, which however are too scary to invest it there where it could be productive and income, with which one could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, England and the Eurozone, $3.4 trillion has been invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3,4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollar, which at the same time runs around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate except the stock markets and advertise real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin-tops, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the U.S., Japan and Europe, and consequently a low total economic demand, which, as in a final loop, is feared by the pessimism of investors that would be true that his son would kill him when he becomes mature,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances that cause Ödipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all this unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all of the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and naturally slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of Athenian democracy as a result of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the toiling poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in matters of the state prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very brightly, it is also quickly burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually shifted politics and escapes them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because the government can now be in the government, and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals they feed, that they end up starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has cannibalised policy so far that it is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives" demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin-tops, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" democrats "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts more deeply, just as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we have to transform the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and take care that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film" matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "in which the human society is in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in all brevity."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or surplus of the respective country, into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which it favors privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Luigi Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, what Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore, I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also completely confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you aren't confused, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think of the Western point of view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- a fully democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I can say this provocative, China is similar today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to reproach China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive deflection line went through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal - by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to fall, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's creditors imposed on this policy said: "this was a colossal mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be catastrophic for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we furnish ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, according to which it seems to me it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairdresser and refers to Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible to choose the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted, where after you have looked at a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not concerned about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean emulation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something so, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he stops a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes up many ideas for TV shows and selects eight Candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon publishes things for nothing, one accesses, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts are skipped or watched again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many people don't remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5, i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows whose course they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so it's a bit scary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a dismissal occurs."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could predict eruptions of flu, the bad way, through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly need to do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do it several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for that and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like" House of Cards, "that wasn't in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "that's what the data says."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "most likely" "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will test it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have heard in hindsight to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing, and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
