Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t chapel which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card mou@@ ths encourages exciting stories to days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows who had to get upset because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially very revealing . &quot;
especially when compared to current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ered carpet that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ mor@@ dial pet@@ als , were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian survey administration , these were originated between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbors , who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische veying management . &quot;
&quot; the copyright for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
the comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is Unter@@ send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was registered 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was only named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West @-@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming into it a smaller @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original photograph &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots have no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the territory of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the guest @-@ gate &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once blocked people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchor of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric clinics , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet at the site of the former institution .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth home with training establishments .
&quot; to the west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east , east residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural ad@@ moni@@ tion to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 56 the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; main place &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line will take place . &quot;
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen Rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ thing has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special care when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rapid @-@ based incidents have been found throughout the country in recent times . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the enforcement agencies of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people will pass . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ander died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no use of petrol during the trip and was put in custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , where it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be prepared to bring their deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such violations to the country &apos;s 16th position . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states committed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in the opinion of the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U parliam@@ ent@@ arians Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have acquired a picture on the spot .
&quot; in the square courtyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ locality met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este lies exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also a BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; essential . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t work profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much has to be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not perform bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for their support
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded half by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmer remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lords it is not . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiß was also firm : &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Development Agency ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides state support for pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is to keep the Black Forest open .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveying set marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; moreover , the enclosed area must not be smu@@ gg@@ able ( inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project 2018 , the application for eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build just 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sor@@ ely staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposal of the President to dr@@ astic restrictions of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to mention a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is just right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring say@@ ings of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ding waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mps USA are not welcome .
this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis after their death - knew very well that they had a high political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical illustration .
&quot; Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the um@@ bel@@ ated world : &quot; Lady Liberty dies . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh has encountered something here .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their sole source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praise Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members one time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to figure it out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner of the street .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought about , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the Middle @-@ wing@@ ed Mu@@ ir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be included in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Scot@@ sman who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete there , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t s@@ wir@@ l around a public office if you cannot tolerate the voice of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , safe . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat@@ sink .
he has shown a firm hand in the conduct of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skil@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair @-@ loose head @-@ based chemotherapy to his side .
hence the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum known as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the News Broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people are rather dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the governor described as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control articles or arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them . &quot;
but exactly that just happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was in Virginia last week .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect like the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers appe@@ aled to his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European Union no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who left the Arch@@ er@@ field links right up to the final round last year , joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job as he laid down this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champi@@ onships for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels very special , &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on homeland floor . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce is one of the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , parking costs £ 5 per car with an in@@ mate and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths are due to passive smoking &quot; , &quot; said Director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he made his own study on this subject in 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been around 400 cancer cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works at the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably over time , &quot; says the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot to hide in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
traffic that hin@@ ders the construction work is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s tru@@ pp .
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and shut @-@ off bags is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ligh@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ peaceful Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the su@@ cked tu@@ ber is taken out and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless space serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occupying forces by public raising . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses that are surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrugated roofs that have been converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaf@@ s on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wood resources worth valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
&quot; after greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ lian demands thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we value everything &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week events happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have strengthened since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it tasted the native Papua , Mama M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - her market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov , promised in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Papua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ os in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ligh@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers crashed on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se on their tone and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and killed the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into the coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles , im@@ iti@@ sing a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to put stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; states it in an official TI@@ ME document not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ car@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who was witness to shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only has a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Che@@ ap spec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ port@@ edly said that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks later , Jok@@ ov in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ elled to address the historical ab@@ uses of Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Safety , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he would establish a judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical violations of human rights . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he talked to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , charged by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; that demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody vote of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been inflic@@ ted in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear of years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ elle repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began firing at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called upon the officers to be held ac@@ countable and to withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ el , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by insti@@ lling spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in en@@ arot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; you retain most of the crop for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of notation cost only 10.000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire &apos;s airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Papua have rarely invested capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Papua , due to lack of coordination with turned institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ov &apos;s election campaign have not been realized , the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ har@@ sh@@ est provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ oa : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s alle@@ gations : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited him on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ov as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly in front of the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never get justice , but at least they do not let those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire found its passage in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which has been swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cries of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup singles was only supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics are preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was barely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal was not at all ready for the vote to carry out the finale at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ er , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring banned items into the aircraft . find out a pol@@ l
&quot; a survey among flying passengers resulted in more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ consciously banned items at the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while acci@@ dentally comm@@ itting forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said they had discovered that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents that admitted they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said , know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ viewed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it asked travelers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods had brought about the airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are closest to smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who are most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquid they can take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancelled order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to speci@@ alize with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ scored that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed another , less brilliant number for the first time in the publication of the latest quar@@ terly record : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; during the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars : 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders . &quot;
critics always pointed out that it is simply non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the 2018 aims to put together all models - 500,000 in 2020 , one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are available per day . &quot;
&quot; anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never even tested production lines with maximum load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if there are too much delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in flocks .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the reluct@@ ance of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes that his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a period that was running for countries on October 1 , in order to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was President Donald Tru@@ mp At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or dela@@ ying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal back@@ lash for the P@@ ru@@ ing regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA is often not adher@@ ing to deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority we give us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress impose upon a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Prosecutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

Tum@@ bling Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade at 4.@@ 30 p.m. on Sunday , 16 July . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the 6th Charity Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gen their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ s@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the parish church to Tum@@ bling and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the former parish church , a noble courtyard with which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible today in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age emerged from the early medieval property law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , ref@@ unded and occupied with a priest , continued to remain the owner of this church and could also glori@@ fy this own church . &quot;
this was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two were crushed by Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bells rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church . &quot;
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary Church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; during the New Year night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower of today still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ alle and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old grav@@ ey@@ ard to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann pron@@ oun@@ ces the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; for the seren@@ ade of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tumours and hearing @-@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of authorization on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , because at the time in Vier@@ sen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to adopt a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , but the city of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf due to a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also declined , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; resist@@ s . &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a licence for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the circle Vier@@ sen from last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter .
&quot; however , they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a NEW affiliate , plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had concluded contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Four @-@ sen urban coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her car during the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and September 9th in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to the &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action aims not only on residents of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
this means that the trade association and the city enter another stage of the &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; project .
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ fest including sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them into active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be newly developed or re@@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping out of sight .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , King had said to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly spreading . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen informed that five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time participate in the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the campaign conducted by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her behaviour in a direct way .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new further people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first mis@@ match was later found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of fact , the authorities assumed works on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building .
Tru@@ mp placed after in@@ ked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp requested a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compla@@ ined that he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp termin@@ ates the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants suspended in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams tore the silence , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience liked very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were retri@@ eved by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old Con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , the emphasis serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
&quot; a court physician puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but nobody was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com found a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she bore was not of her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they came out of jail and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and expos@@ ing the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their depic@@ tion is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is well @-@ founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve been doing .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - came into a room and listened , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room actors , Ac@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cries out and p@@ ushes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n -- he , wa@@ ving away from my property ! &quot;
An@@ cona returns the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , Gre@@ ene said , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- &apos; said &apos; n &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when An@@ cona tells the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition starts violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a dream dress is over the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song fade out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ g rope and wipe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white couple from Atlanta ch@@ ats about the rep@@ lica with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x continues to go on , &quot; she added , &quot; today , the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone broo@@ ks Broo@@ ks court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the emphasis is in a certain sense inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ sts to Bayreuth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of it is an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine fun@@ nels are pos@@ ing as rock energies , or alternatively a is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine bowls - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a corp@@ se in the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ kon@@ o @-@ cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen which surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he dre@@ aded Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in this .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , who humble himself and for@@ wards the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual wear . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to have a g@@ inger concert about himself , five years later , there was great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations were going down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I prefer a positive resume .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; a lot : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I &apos;m helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at the school in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does this come about ?
quantity : I did a SL@@ C .
&quot; and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what to do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social sector . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and I study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - all sorts of facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is different from civil engineering ?
&quot; of course , here it is not about calculating St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
you always have other people in front of you who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
&quot; for that , I am not the guy . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts further 3.000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut her divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , the general director John Fall@@ on , announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 points . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May , to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared a declaration of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ Arab neighbourhood . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence done by Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Arab ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there have been at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack on the country since the US @-@ led troops inv@@ aded the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le Accor@@ ding to C@@ lay
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 , &quot; and said that it showed the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remind us that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to define the o@@ zone regulations - in which in some of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured , in order to comply with stric@@ ter aviation quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed a law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tru@@ mp , should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the return of demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
common room wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tw@@ inkl@@ es the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church is owned by the church community until now , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , there is a discussion about a common room . &quot;
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council flo@@ ats to see such a common room not as a meeting point only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the running budget has already been decided by funding opportunities last autumn . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ let between your legs , finding that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which are le@@ aning on the surrounding area - as well as a pull @-@ out roof - which reduces the tr@@ ash height and makes the construction more economical - possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not mean this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not that easy for the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many own buildings with which one does not get so much forward , but now they lean on the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger insi@@ sts on the common room - but absolutely opposed to a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy on wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but will receive a genuine , in case of doubt a market@@ able exchange value , that is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ be@@ ers proposal , to ple@@ ad the resolution according to the proposal , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme , which sums up Stefan H@@ aller . &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a huge step in closing a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : cyclists will be thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the Schwar@@ zer Road from Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road of Schwar@@ zer . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver travelling in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retri@@ eval car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba does not have to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel care at the German football record master Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; also Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official contest of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin from star to star hike
&quot; in the resin , the nationwide &quot; &quot; Star@@ Path &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; meets the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , called it . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber came into question . &quot;
the information on the boards should be added on the internet .
&quot; this is why , when selecting a location , a good mobile network receives a roll . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ path train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the base path the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star sh@@ one more strongly than another although it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; also , in which star picture a selected star is found and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot;
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the funding association Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ cked down to the d@@ warf @-@ planets at the end point - are placed exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 mil@@ lim@@ eter diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measuring 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet trail is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from the sun is up to the Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ spring weight champion . &quot;
&quot; following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they ask the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to agree on the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight for the network offering the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show striking strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ ners
&quot; in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the market width at 4.@@ 30 am shortly before the market width . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sur@@ rendered and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; and@@ re Hoffmann , after 2 : 2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig , hopes for the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two ad@@ versaries too much and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain @-@ chain is also to be optimised further . &quot;
and a gate after a release does not want to catch the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
for the future it will be like no one next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line .
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is able to cope better even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ hand chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t afford so many playback errors in the setup . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a draw from a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can sit on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days of play , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a climb favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday attend the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we claim to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which must be sm@@ ashed from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ y does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results from the Swedish asylum holder evaluation tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ son of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det looked for the 5@@ 81 results published , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot say , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Traffic and Transport in the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began at the same time on all three major bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is an arch @-@ arch @-@ bridge of concrete that is cla@@ d with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come to the fore in the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sandstone .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
&quot; this is a marginal fix@@ ture , which is also used as operational path . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a bridge of 2,@@ 20 meters will be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian path is to take place .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ tip @-@ attitude has required the laying of lines through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fibre cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs over the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collector section in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is inter@@ lac@@ ed by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is difficult to put under one hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ th Vol@@ can@@ ic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are part of a broad alliance that will show a peaceful flag that day , because the Af@@ D invites rally in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to a loud &quot; big election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ l formed the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D eag@@ les , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the well @-@ ground , but now takes place on the parking place below the Ro@@ un@@ del - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , &quot; &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ er reports from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel to have stri@@ ved for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there are not enough parking places available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ torium is about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli exists in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo osi@@ tions in European peak orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the N@@ ils W@@ ogram jazz award winner , classical , jazz and free games blend into a fascinating overall artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt very bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I have ever wanted . &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d have played it ?
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten said she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
I have never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in the school period when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have dist@@ anced themselves from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally beforehand .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal deal from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party without leadership and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC president , Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught from competition gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments , the IA@@ AF agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e re@@ porters . &quot;
the whole Council and the entire Congress pleased that the Russian Federation has seen in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships that start Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral act for soldiers cut off in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the Northern Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; as a matter of fact , defense minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ clari@@ fied cause of the crash . &quot;
&quot; she called the two opposite pilots , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice carried out in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
&quot; after that the funeral procession began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics . &quot;
&quot; among them , H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the gri@@ ev@@ ous branches laid down the rose , the members standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen labeled the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and collap@@ sed . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had set up the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the Mali mission in Mali did not show the minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife . &quot;
that told the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to reign . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also took part in the title &quot; &quot; Prin@@ ted Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family . &quot;
he was working on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympathy for the people &apos;s sympathy , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ ch@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and those in Germany had the reputation of being the brand of company @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority in Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising ex@@ iting of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to include them .
&quot; with it , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its next action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament de@@ votes the trust and sel@@ ects a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be scrut@@ ini@@ zed legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss in peace all the questions , if they are legally tested . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ as step &quot; but a little kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called himself a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we naturally expect that they will have their land convention , which they have received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Green Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even in view of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has played this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to hit political capital from it .
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to take El@@ ke T@@ ests into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking and answer . &quot;
Herr Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ mem@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are presently aware of , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected immediately and is in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany &apos;s concern . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same importance as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ out products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
&quot; if eggs do not exceed 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not rush @-@ capable . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current knowledge , the production facilities are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little inspec@@ tor in the event of harvest . &quot;
is there only a lack of staff or of the competence of conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have exposed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ arms necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to exclusively buy safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ ted means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps .
how the Fis@@ cal Rules of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been funded without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and brings him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be tax@@ ed with legitimate income sources , which enable them to break even the break even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the club to monitor its losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - becoming a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reporting period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini fell from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to over@@ look their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor &apos;s sponsorship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup 2022 .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a maneu@@ ver could be easily determined for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to follow any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not entitled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsorship contracts , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new warehouse supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sal@@ ute cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da a report from the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packaged chocolate bags of 14 gram , each year , distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing . &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss won &apos;t want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new tender .
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo at the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights customers of First Class are spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ aschen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y on the short circuit , both in business and Economy Class . &quot;

&quot; this repetition of history is simultaneously nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ th years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children , who will grow - nevertheless , they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adult , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy takes more on the casting principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point sticks a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
there is another mad @-@ evil plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well sung impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ pp@@ elling of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random del@@ usion that this fran@@ chise could pre@@ heat like a repeti@@ tive &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; series until he achieves what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Amazon , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose dialo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ uting producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are syn@@ ced .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan @-@ mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it is moving , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was adjusted to a lower length could deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always attending the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in making a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the process , 15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the event of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
&quot; in the event , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in Southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large use was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , especially Italian nation@@ als came to the Italian ma@@ fia with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way to complain large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to large gaps in the immigration centre register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; according to data , the Register records ten million people with foreign nationality , including 5.@@ 7 million non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens , and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on a sufficient number of people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate funding , &quot; stated in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have been lod@@ ged there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF is performing such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper has reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Convention , refugees from the EU state will be in charge of them first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also return refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights violations and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; first of all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
traditionally the congregation hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the municipal council meeting .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created for it and we give respect to the don@@ ors , who make their blood available for strangers , nor non @-@ profit , &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ons are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DRC . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry joined the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many booked Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , during Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened speculation on an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure .
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 for holding the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving for an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned against the pressure on domestic income , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that interest rates would be necessary over the next few years to brid@@ le the inflation @-@ heated inflation and she said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected on the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper banks for banks from the upcoming February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the Gross Dom@@ estic Product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to bur@@ dened consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and the next year are forecast to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared with the expected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest rate increase , and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases , as the tigh@@ tening is even worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; , &quot; but she added that the wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecasts are &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the fall of the P@@ act . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers asking a rise to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders tend to look for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those who run out the existing deals and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people the disputed HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis received prior to sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS claimed the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make the registration of people possible and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in risk of infection .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those involved in the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants will be identified which agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , which is specifically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed specifically on needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with a high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will soon be carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former Bank@@ erin with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne st@@ ow@@ age and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned architect and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to release the presentation .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed together , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it work longer .
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metre number of some standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate investment
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate because of one of the largest real estate in Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation with the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - Paul referred to as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot;
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but proposes Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an shop of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was the High School in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass her property on to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in retired , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , he was the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tru@@ mp &apos;s new chief of staff plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mps White House he wanted to repair : bad information that he got into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; &quot; said the former campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg against Politi@@ co in February . &quot;
&quot; at the time , Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mps Twitter habits under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal consumption of media includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials are aware of something we don &apos;t know from others - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ et would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his employees manage to keep his anger away from him several times , then their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons , to supply du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp is able to react to negative press releases like a volcano , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false alle@@ gations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; he added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped for . &quot;
&quot; in this summer ( virtual ) postcards , the police in Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot;
&quot; since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the campaign following the winter following the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar .
&quot; experience had shown that many cur@@ ri@@ sts were hiding on holiday destinations , called it Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 Post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online con@@ fessions were previously arrested , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire range &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travelers on the base of war , which have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ off road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by holding long teachings to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge if the advice doesn &apos;t even stop .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even has seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case .
&quot; at Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes part of the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year .
they are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue generated by the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a colle@@ cti@@ ble shelter , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the site of the hotel and already spoke of serious interest in the house back then . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with its head office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof long time construction waste containers have been placed in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings are broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; later on , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms wants to set up broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the exterior systems are also brought to foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special educ@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special educ@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the panel has recorded the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to target themselves in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp election team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tru@@ mps private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Agent Tru@@ mp had personally moved into the center and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the President might hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible break@@ through@@ s and decide whether to be charged .
&quot; Grand jur@@ ys , therefore , are also called the Coun@@ ts of In@@ dict@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on if they are larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to take part under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting had been invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the setting indicates that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he would react quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President of the Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the issue gives the demo@@ crats a possibility to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about .
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; this work , however , usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he will not be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this rage , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey said before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air around the later res@@ igned president , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move . &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators put draft bill on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fest . &quot;
this was confirmed by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tri@@ l@@ lion t and 5@@ 800 square kilometre large Kol@@ oss is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant , which researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
&quot; in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a factor background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us so far .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ orts was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete mis@@ sile file .
&quot; there is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f file is in danger , as the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can collapse if at a key point a piece breaks off . &quot;
&quot; the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and put ice as much water as it results after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glacier flows directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly raise sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists argue whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us will continue to grow again or go back long @-@ term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these explor@@ ers did not return to climate change this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , however , in the past few decades , however , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to join the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have penet@@ rated the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first day of work . &quot;
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied positions at M@@ ett@@ mann Kreis . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for human resources generation and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for experts , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition for public employers . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a high number of employees , due to illness or age , are eliminated from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , head of faction of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common request with his party . &quot;
he had long ago caused a bad surprise when he questioned the personal costs of the personnel and the other parties were stun@@ ned .
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the communal employer &apos;s association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration should strive for a house tari@@ ff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; said Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials , when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only when you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrant b@@ ail@@ outs
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they may not continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it &apos;s hard to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself on detailed repro@@ aches of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which will be delivered directly by traffi@@ ckers and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which supervis@@ es rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer to monitor their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs active in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine wil@@ ler bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Harv@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ ages market .
&quot; on the other hand , a view of the viewpoint , connected by &quot; &quot; flying &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought low @-@ will@@ ed breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers at@@ m@@ ated healing Sole in the open @-@ air @-@ inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
also Neustadt has been controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - athle@@ tic and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga suits e @-@ sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future rather than racing through the stadium ra@@ mps with wind and weather ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included . &quot;
&quot; this has also recognized the first federal li@@ ga@@ des , which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; there are several clubs coming up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven are qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , one could be present online more often on these markets than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA are fought at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the 2022 World Cup , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ o has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and take care of the diet . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , fi@@ rob@@ atics also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; check @-@ ups are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are on their way around the world , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study conducted by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte couns@@ ell@@ ors write . &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;

there are a lot of things happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the Football League associations , according to D@@ utt , have meanwhile been obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; writes D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only when you play football , everything remains as it always was . &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free up to the appeal .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter At@@ tor@@ ney at law said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; which she totally regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another comm@@ itting suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring out of a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended the Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 due to murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern th@@ aw@@ ns a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me right away , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself a rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ me was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s holiday makers , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from holidays . &quot;
sugar is most likely to be distributed to those of whom you want a lot to keep in your mood .
&quot; those who were chosen to take on the heritage of L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : assume responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flour@@ ished as a mini @-@ under@@ took over the field . &quot;
&quot; to the right , this is his position , the white band@@ age on her arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ e seemed like the one who can best take the helm . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to steer the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Vi@@ dal resist@@ s his lack of fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ chs wanted to make a stop@@ over on the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
but that worked quite well .
&quot; Sü@@ ver ran along with Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game @-@ building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also brought up . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said goodbye to some cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the newcom@@ er any more . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies

the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz minister : economy lo@@ oms d@@ ress@@ ings pace
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V enquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister of Ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; sing takes up the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry is hoping for a schedul@@ ing process , until 2021 is intended to be the construction right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the German transport network . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says government spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in this , nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims to increase the trend of German wine exports , which has been declining for ten years , to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the final exam and 2500 euros if graduates stay independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time out of the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 29 jobs were occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to recru@@ it mobility in the state @-@ owned company . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; commenting on the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points out more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated grid supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ business minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW told BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said the company said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - prohi@@ bit or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but drive back to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen servants were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could hardly pol@@ lu@@ te Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors also take part , on the mor@@ row Saturday a raft runs through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ Bridge . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the Construction Department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft across the Is@@ ar and also this year , there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ens and the laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published cartoon drawing , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he , among other things , suggested to himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo statues set in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own statements , he still sits at the drawing table , works daily for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll characters continue to spread widely worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as a counter player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the movie screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he rather focuses on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ati@@ lessly . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and the insect @-@ borne insects , leading scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years , which in spring has caused a lot of rain and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has an impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ds , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ um@@ ers and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lacking or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ fu@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings range . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government or cart@@ els pay@@ roll list , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while the corp@@ ses are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are its editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime every year , journalists are rarely tried by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ fu@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we are di@@ str@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an province capital . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ ships that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was extra@@ di@@ ted to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ fu@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without confron@@ ting the drug @-@ poison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ fu@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead men ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ fu@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n @-@ bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ er , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ fu@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the space where the employees of Ri@@ fu@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself said to be un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountains , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ fu@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories . &quot;
there was assass@@ ination of brother of former well @-@ known Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
&quot; there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter heard of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high @-@ cali@@ bre corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in whom a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military raid . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs , and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become spe@@ ech@@ less by laying down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ appropriate society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close how the El Nor@@ te newspaper in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , announces that drug trafficking will frigh@@ ten him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , so I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ fu@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to h@@ um . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with strip riv@@ als and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are how@@ ling nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; If on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used clo@@ ak to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; now , researchers have found out that the first insights of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of an &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the sub@@ du@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth@@ cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ er , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ screening , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and sof@@ ten its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; powerful car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have to have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay brown .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea where he sank to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier really is remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but also stays in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ ful ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was born on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the sub@@ du@@ ed arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous has been swept through the western Canada , until a flooded river floo@@ ding it into the open sea . &quot;
but the cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ est still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &quot; rare as winning the lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the Thunder@@ storm : mass Kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ ses
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ ism .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometre @-@ long stands - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass incar@@ nation on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first reports of the police , between 17@@ .00 hrs , between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into one another . &quot;
&quot; at first , no data was given to the exact number of injured persons . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of travel Munich an approximately ten kilometres long back@@ stage was formed .
&quot; as reported by A@@ Z Re@@ porter , there were also massive han@@ di@@ caps on the counter @-@ track - numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade became the hall@@ mark of the vehicle drivers , who now have to calculate with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on his way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit on the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
&quot; the conductor comes and aw@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected , or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ dates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the train without any conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers are already doing anyway .
&quot; it also has to be purchased through the app of the track , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient kind of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the test customers , a button for the electronic evaluation will be displayed . &quot;
the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at No@@ .@@ y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can sleep on , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train atten@@ dant , the DB Navigator will check for yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often run rail know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because of@@ ten@@ times you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to point out .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time taking care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other net numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
only one day after arriving in New York City was sitting in St. Louis Born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly vi@@ gil@@ ant on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people crying , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father , who bore a shield with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried out , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled her statement . &quot;
this is not the sort of murder we have gotten used to and that we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and of protest , of love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be educated in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the happiness to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black female child . &quot;
I feel I would do a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l asked a question : &quot; do you want to document , or do you try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ street in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , for this is how I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life , as she falls in love with and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager by Martin in 2012 , have marked the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement really is held upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who fed up with this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though it was on the front line , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels bound to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; It would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , the rest of which also benefit from the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always very gladly again . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery sett@@ les in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping m@@ alls in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets , I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle will remain . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is inexpensive on top of that . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and there is no need for a shopping centre , which is empty . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I think - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ sw@@ abs and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st made a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publicly sponsored diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ national and tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg developed by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already openly talked about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison kept her picture supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , where Mann@@ ing was obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette dum@@ b and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned mice became too un@@ equal spectac@@ les , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a cartoon called &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o in which the president would translate the condem@@ nation of Chelsea and she would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama really was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of lucky coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tru@@ mp takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for their over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is endowed with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with me is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free telephone in hand from the disciplinary courts of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they shut up your speech , they won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ ose bum@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as fores@@ een in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
&quot; a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) have issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the records of the District Court of Cook County show .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police agency of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the site of the event , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively search for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
since 2007 La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ esa , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them would now be subject to scrut@@ iny and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates on this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he challenged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a vision of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives including a possible domestic incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA @-@ timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s timetable for compliance with the code describing the criteria for re@@ covering R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to do with Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system conf@@ essed a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ i &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has preferred to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from WA@@ DA in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore &quot;
these divided the groups of companies .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could continue to be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly negative tested on the fi@@ pron@@ il@@ lic anti @-@ lice product . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency in his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up at your employees but the surveys did not work .
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to handle surveys , to address special groups and demographic groups , to circum@@ vent employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers manage to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from specific teams , there is a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth in 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent uses customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main managing director is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found to treat its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry went online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices heard , and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about employee engagement according to the workplace culture experts is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take any measures .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , there may be an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , ask yourself , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported , so saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bonding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it is about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have stri@@ pped off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center in the morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of players . &quot;
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the brothers postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the regulation change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they stick on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ ine Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been abandoned with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ post , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then view their results from the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential fal@@ seh@@ oods and to send them to factor inspec@@ tors , which may indicate results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to get rid of hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English that a test of the new facts @-@ review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fac@@ ten@@ ders third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot;

&quot; a Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Swi@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena kno@@ bs on the walls and the bottles that had centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 than the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years when aristo@@ crats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the times of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who had something : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portrayed from the 18th century who filled his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug up ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , always pay debts and spend money on things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men qu@@ en@@ ched their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ ams &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the casing of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; they write on their yesterday released webpage . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that as a bad Honne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the campaign is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , it stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the City of Bad Honnef celebrates its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions at the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the discussions took place under the chair@@ manship of the Government , now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the number of survivors . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the coup failed , Prime Minister Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired up 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ porter of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called a &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the cover ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the major contribution to the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , by decree , Erdo@@ gan burned more than 7@@ 3@@ 95 public servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als formerly considered the actual masters of the country .
three times they shared their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least in calling on the reform specifications of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving forward deliberately an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an officer who was named after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad was waiting for the Turkish army to be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower legal migrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by the US to change the way citizens from other countries will be issued green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race @-@ climb shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , the future of racing sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested over the past few months - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , there is to be built on the mar@@ oon distance on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will start on the route this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself above all to the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; explained the Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
it cost around 2.5 million euros to repair the route .
&quot; from this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway as operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be regularly ordered in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is very b@@ ump@@ y in parts . &quot;
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it could not be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye @-@ color to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would let a step@@ per woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired of being fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , fre@@ t one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ves with a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what perme@@ ates the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of the time we live , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who pra@@ ved to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn @-@ out body and the filed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their builders want them to feel human , that they mim@@ ic the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
you can &apos;t separate yourself from your companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything , which might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the wisdom of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US voters have also split families in small format .
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
we all o@@ sten@@ si@@ ly strive to burst out our filter bubbles .
less has been noticed by the power of Tru@@ mps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago , has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with whom she fought for decades for politics suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it seems to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the eman@@ ating effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appears as a concept of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself being attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the New York Parks , and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn around to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ b music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage in fact - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 @-@ 40 years and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman at the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ ously gr@@ ind@@ ingly , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to submit to her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was hospit@@ alized because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
he was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp at the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year term of pist@@ achi@@ o appeal , from which they say they were too indul@@ gent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the schools of the Flo@@ wers , the four @-@ thous@@ ander from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and to the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the class@@ rooms will go to high school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school judge An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grew up in the hen &apos;s farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle at the hen &apos;s farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it hat@@ ched by his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle wide spread its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore cylinders to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every neighborhood boy that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thank@@ ful to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always starts with instruc@@ tional passes , and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cum@@ ber@@ some time was over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , they only leave their students very reluct@@ ant , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ thous@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer@@ time and holiday time . &quot;
it was a great pleasure for the children .
eight first @-@ runners have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal camp people were arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free Camp@@ s and put on everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve emissions from emissions of Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ e@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates negotiated are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but they have not yet been called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write to every affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it might be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot;
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
there is no loss of value for older Diesel in rural areas so far .
the ACE reveals to wait with a sale yet .

&quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker is a town @-@ builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he con@@ veys in the press interview .
&quot; he reports about varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it makes it wonder that so far no application requirements fulfil the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the next time .
&quot; in this way , taking into account the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for training . &quot;
&quot; as Has@@ lach acts as a Lower House Legal Office for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must present relevant degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg to advise . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity of citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years of office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worthy of life , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking space for example have come across .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in design , there is great scope for a city building master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and landsc@@ aping , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is in place &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the reti@@ ring city building master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the City Buil@@ der bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wishes himself : &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
who would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed degree in architecture as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of building and building planning law .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to high@@ - and civil engineering , construction management planning , basic facilities , administration of urban buildings , municipal farm with building yard and municipal gardening , as well as underground building law office , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle tos@@ sed on lines : South railway track closed
&quot; according to police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , a rose @-@ sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have brought themselves into danger themselves and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail transport , the cul@@ pr@@ its could also come to the cul@@ pr@@ its . &quot;
&quot; all in all , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway track could be guided without a han@@ di@@ cap . &quot;
&quot; just under ten persons , Friday morning had dropped out , two of them related to the traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains were not cancelled , but they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products may allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han fav@@ ours less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also affects humans . &quot;
&quot; post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that fo@@ stered tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but it had not had this . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given the L. Cross and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us are prot@@ esting L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho requested three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such publicity earlier .
&quot; the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire @-@ fire from the party centre , merely no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election warri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were precip@@ itation .
and one by one .
&quot; following the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising faction of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition consequently lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ German business leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the back@@ sliding Saxon Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to give back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; an SPD election fighter gro@@ ans , when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the over@@ stepping of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
it is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er started with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , not more , the comrades were so@@ oth@@ ed at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; it was then , and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into pi@@ cket , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades stro@@ ve again in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next set@@ back .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his ni@@ city on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he made everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been critic@@ ised for some time now . &quot;
mi@@ ological survey data were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation during the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , remained un@@ concealed in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is basically no fault with the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz did not at all .
&quot; for the time being , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to Parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &quot; willingness four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who is leading the Lower Saxon SPD as a leading candidate in the German Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding funds for local core III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed urban development on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , it has been in sensi@@ cal san@@ itation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the former refurb@@ ishment is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which € 500 000 came from the country , the rest from the community . &quot;
how does a san@@ itation area develop ?
&quot; I will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area any interest exists . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial limits may be moved again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; federal program in which the san@@ itation would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
&quot; since January 1 , 2017 the permit period for the funding medium runs until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of inventory , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation project , to fill out a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statutes shall be carried out as soon as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year . &quot;
&quot; after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every commune must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations . &quot;
it is a matter of assessing and determining the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when it will be remedi@@ ed and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective land , there will also be a renovation note in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to the senses and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project is a key success factor for the project . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it concerns the structural state and the rehabilitation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing sheet &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be filled out if the premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , it is to be noted that Got@@ hart pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first warns first .
no funds can be reserved for later . &quot;
&quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; Urban II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology is similar to a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising expenses of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s specifications left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ klift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the helicopter was built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the recordings of the helicopter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy commander of the naval aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message was that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours . &quot;
the original crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
&quot; at the disposal of the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act promises to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could violate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation , when the president &apos;s plane landed in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy spokes@@ man of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn , in order to reduce the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was one of the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers did not take charge of any of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget labels for the presidential pl@@ ou@@ ghs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for V@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to highlight this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp had been inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
top riders of the Second Tennis League meet at the Table 3 Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite having five games still flaw@@ less , the top riders of the Second Tennis League won the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has in any case respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
imports from the high North are mainly responsible for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .

&quot; this is as always difficult for us .
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can damage O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp wasn &apos;t really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress prepared a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels hur@@ led against the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the O@@ MV , which jointly co @-@ financed with other European companies , have contributed to the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership ( Nord Stream 2 ) . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions even per executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed at the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Kil@@ ler , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; only with more state bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) appro@@ ves the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro is returning as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bites and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lun@@ ch@@ time again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in urban kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of the house : a cat@@ erer gets this task and delivers fresh co@@ iled refriger@@ ated .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon . &quot;
&quot; last year &apos;s kit@@ eline , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand grew steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are taken care of 45 days of the week eat lunch at the K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff will have a kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the meals delivered , complement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een units - decides on the scale of the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the function of the kitchen staff - is handled by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign lending for the city . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with around 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , official head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ al@@ ising in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban released threats to a choice trial , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international hos@@ ti@@ lities to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , &quot; &quot; a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the men talked about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the mobile phone of the girl . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell &apos;s cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed . &quot;
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern over investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure a long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment in the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products , Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; be first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the director of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim to &quot; say &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metrop@@ olitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; this is why , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; over the past few years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn you three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La League likes to regret the interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b to N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always been doing its best to take care of it since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to get one of our players signed , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator intentionally dis@@ car@@ ded one sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle was damaged by over 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for clu@@ es . &quot;
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car came to meet him on his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ ted the control plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the en@@ cir@@ cle@@ ment of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his lane , so that he had to escape to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ted the control plan . &quot;
no damage was created on the passenger car .
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident victims , it can be good that the Mercedes @-@ Benz driver didn &apos;t notice the accident at all . &quot;
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the perpetr@@ ator to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report rati@@ fies Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he expected from former bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would greatly benefit the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their incorrect estim@@ ation of the processes at that time .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence against the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it would be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ en@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a stained glass .
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows were a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse incidents , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely un@@ ju@@ stly , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the memory book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analyses the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; altogether 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by master master R. R. in many cases physical and psychological violence were used . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be heavier . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , hes@@ emann explained why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was hand @-@ gr@@ asp@@ ed by the latter , when a domain @-@ set musi@@ cally did not bring top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all . &quot;
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can pre@@ tend to experience it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the cath@@ ed@@ r@@ istic gymn@@ asi@@ um on which it worked was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to erup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; he did not just kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also pulled ear @-@ fi@@ gs and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself already ad@@ mits to years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to be hon@@ our@@ able , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period , the 1960s and the 1970s , in parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced it in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , those are Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his not@@ ori@@ ety and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the media reported a lot about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or co @-@ ordination with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault con@@ tends to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in the education of sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
what is the role of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ? s R@@ ole in view of the abuse incidents ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insights and would have been able to stop the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it is absurd to assume that it is just absurd to assume that ... more penet@@ rable or clearer or even more open than in relation to their parents , dormit@@ ories , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings confi@@ ded in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak about any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not preventing him or having brought him to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to link up his good name with these contradictory crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former master kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; Per@@ spectives . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gi@@ cs , the cases in which the children of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally victi@@ mi@@ zed and mal@@ igned and suffered , all happened at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he only got the boy when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; . &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore combine positive memories with him in numerous cases despite violence . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be seen . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which the states were reported to him at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then only back in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test fin@@ es had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the persons affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards for the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; fall@@ out of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; so the danger of evaluating past past moral standards . &quot;
the princess was quite right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and not for what was ban@@ ished in the pre @-@ school of resist@@ ances and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , therefore sla@@ p the ear and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , it was also strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; which image of his time of Regensburg has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of the sentence also speak to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells us from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plays only a side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not mention that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , one does not even make a big vo@@ cal@@ ist and before every success , right in which area , yet always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
&quot; what kind of people have you , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , have seen in the talks about her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , heart@@ felt , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could do something like a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and rever@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : all that one proposes to him are educational methods which were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stop command would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
