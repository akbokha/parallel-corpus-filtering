<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card mouths encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had to get upset because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when compared to current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickered carpet that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"detailed maps, so-called primordial petals, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian survey administration, these were originated between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbors, who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische veying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the copyright for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, found on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is Untersendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was registered 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling were concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the West-park is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming into it a smaller-part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called" "original photograph" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small plots have no more farmers - but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the territory of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name" "at the guest-gate" "or" "On the air" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once blocked people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüfte" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of the psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who worked for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power plant in Hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric clinics, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet at the site of the former institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich east, east residential houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built - in architectural admonition to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in 1856 the Marienplatz was listed as" "main place", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farthing has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special care when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, rapid-based incidents have been found throughout the country in recent times."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people will pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sander died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no use of petrol during the trip and was put in custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, where it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be prepared to bring their deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state with respect to the number of such violations to the country's 16th position."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states committed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further racial profiling in the opinion of the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Weidefence Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliamentarians Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have acquired a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"in the square courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-locality met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest milk "is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste lies exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also a BLHV Chairman of Fishermen's bach, he described the electric fence project as" essential. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't work profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much has to be machined with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parental plant and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not perform bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for their support</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure surface therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded half by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmer remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do a really good job, without farmers and landlords it is not. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiß was also firm:" "best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Development Agency (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides state support for pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveying set marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the enclosed area must not be smuggable (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's electric fence project 2018, the application for eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface is 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sorely staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposal of the President to drastic restrictions of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiters would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to mention a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is just right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring sayings of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elding waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis after their death - knew very well that they had a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody, but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame to the umbelated world:" Lady Liberty dies. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh has encountered something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their sole source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praise Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers one time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-piece Scottish contingent in the world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to figure it out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner of the street.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought about, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The Middle-winged Muir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" hugely proud "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be included in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scotsman who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete there, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: don't swirl around a public office if you cannot tolerate the voice of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at the critique, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute we are led as sheep for slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heatsink.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the conduct of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair-loose head-based chemotherapy to his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum known as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hasserfilled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not water-filled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the News Broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some people are rather disregarded as a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the governor described as" "concentrated spam" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control articles or arrest demonstrators and silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect like the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers appealed to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European Union no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who left the Archerfield links right up to the final round last year, joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>

<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," "said Orr, the man of Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm happy about how it went so far.</seg>

<seg id="443">"it is about a period that was running for countries on October 1, in order to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone-related ozone."</seg>

<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal backlash for the Pruing regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>

<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA is often not adhering to deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for execution," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday, 16 July."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the 6th Charity Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. HilariusChapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Ursbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the parish church to Tumbling and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"in addition to the former parish church, a noble courtyard with which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which is still visible today in the village picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage emerged from the early medieval property law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, refunded and occupied with a priest, continued to remain the owner of this church and could also glorify this own church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two were crushed by Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bells rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window panes were inserted and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops camped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and the church-chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"during the New Year night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower of today still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kalle and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as promoter, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old graveyard to the St. HilariusChapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann pronounces the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">"for the serenade of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers take out the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to permit approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim resists" "does not see a legal precondition for the construction and therefore has turned to the councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim resists" has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of authorization on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, because at the time in Viersen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "savings" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to adopt a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, but the city of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf due to a lack of form."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval of approval is still unlawful and therefore also declined," "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim "resists."</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "at this point, the issuance of a licence for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been received by the circle Viersen from last week," "explained a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion of reviewing the matter.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to express itself in terms of the argumentation of the association" Boisheim resists. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"NEW Re, a NEW affiliate, plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Four-sen urban councillor gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="533">The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and September 9th in order to lure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">"as the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced the" home shopping "weekend to sensitize customers for what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods."</seg>
<seg id="535">"accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market."</seg>

<seg id="540">City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="541">This means that the trade association and the city enter another stage of the "Attractive City" project.</seg>
<seg id="542">"this includes new offers, such as the first" Active Day "at the Brunnenfest including sold-out Sunday, talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them into active participation."</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">"in addition, customer potentials should be newly developed or reopened."</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping out of sight.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - up to landlords, the companies of the whole city and clubs."</seg>
<seg id="548">"in the spring, King had said to overcome the lethargy with a network that was partly spreading."</seg>
<seg id="549">"Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen informed that five Thuringian cities for the first time participate in the country's third" home shopping "day."</seg>
<seg id="550">"in addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode."</seg>
<seg id="551">"the day should" promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities, "says Streich."</seg>
<seg id="552">The campaign conducted by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her behaviour in a direct way.</seg>

<seg id="579">"fortunately this terrible scene, played on July 22, is just a post."</seg>
<seg id="580">"but when a loop is thrown around the neck of" "Roger", "almost everyone in the audience liked very real sighs."</seg>
<seg id="581">"since 2005, citizens have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were retrieved by Ku Klux Klan in 1946."</seg>
<seg id="582">No one ever was charged with murder.</seg>
<seg id="583">"it is really inconceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our congregations, although we know who they are," "said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the post."</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year old Congressman of the state Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the emphasis serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected."</seg>
<seg id="587">"we want prosecution, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must obtain justice," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="588">We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.</seg>
<seg id="589">"a court physician puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynch on July 27, 1946."</seg>
<seg id="590">"according to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But nobody was ever indicted.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain on free foot for decades, citizens' rights say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer."</seg>
<seg id="594">"approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom found a white landlord, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman."</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said that rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy and that the baby she bore was not of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">"on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI."</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="598">"but when they came out of jail and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car."</seg>
<seg id="599">"as it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report. "</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, removing evidence and exposing the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks is even more concise.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was an election law massacre," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="603">"they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" if you register, and if you vote, this will happen to you. "</seg>
<seg id="604">"for nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual post of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde."</seg>
<seg id="605">"their depiction is vivid, poignant, and is well-founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that in America no longer exists."</seg>
<seg id="606">"it is difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about Lynch, because we are confronted with the ugliness in all of us," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been doing.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - came into a room and listened, as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece."</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a Greene Co-director.</seg>
<seg id="611">"he has played the role of the boss clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier."</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I'm not so," "said Marbaugh."</seg>
<seg id="613">But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times.</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room actors, Acrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."</seg>
<seg id="615">"the piece begins with Malcom, who cries out and pushes him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, n -- he, waving away from my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Ancona returns the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona. "</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no, Greene said, still giggling."</seg>
<seg id="625">I simply don't think that white people then 'n ---' said 'n'.</seg>
<seg id="626">"but," one of the other black actors. "</seg>
<seg id="627">You just have to hit the hard 'R.'.</seg>
<seg id="628">"and exactly there the energy shifts in space, a sense of companionship replaces the discomfort."</seg>
<seg id="629">"everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Ancona tells the N word, he says it sharp and with imprint."</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition starts violent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">"there are screams, shots and then silence."</seg>
<seg id="635">"a woman clothed with a dream dress is over the corpses of the actors and leads Billie Holidays mourning praise" "Strange Fruit." ""</seg>

<seg id="637">"about a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes."</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">"a couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down only the street."</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgias oppressive moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where Lynch Morde took place, the air feels ghostly."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song fade out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children hock on their heads, register the counterfeit blood and the silent body and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember. "</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the lyng rope and wipe away their tears.</seg>
<seg id="647">"Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit that the clan member has played."</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him.</seg>

<seg id="650">We know that this is not in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="651">You have done this for one reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="653">At one table a white couple from Atlanta chats about the replica with a black couple that they just met.</seg>
<seg id="654">Denise Duplinsky was struggling to find words which felt the performance.</seg>
<seg id="655">"it's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and do that, because they look like you," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="656">"what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lynx continues to go on," she added, "today, the only police shooting is called."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone brooks Brooks court at his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights."</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he started planning the performance next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the emphasis is in a certain sense inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="804">"St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber came into question."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be added on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"this is why, when selecting a location, a good mobile network receives a roll."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the Starpath train will be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the base path the viewers experience much worth knowing, for example on the physics of the individual stars," declared the association. "</seg>

<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the plucked down to the dwarf-planets at the end point - are placed exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>

<seg id="863">"these were two adversaries too much and we have to watch out better in Aue," "says the defense player from Fortuna Düsseldorf."</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-chain-chain is also to be optimised further."</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a release does not want to catch the Fortunas any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">For the future it will be like no one next to Michael (Rensing) puts himself on the line.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is able to cope better even after the experience in preparation with the three-hand chain than with the four-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we are in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we don't afford so many playback errors in the setup."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk about a draw from a mischievous start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="873">"but if we can sit on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer didn't want to know about that.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who didn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season practically with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete play like Fortuna against a climb favorites in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know as 100% where they are currently standing," says the inner defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday attend the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we claim to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in only a defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göranson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the figures are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age.</seg>

<seg id="996">"despite its comments, the IAAF agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer to this day, a very honest presentation," "said IAAF President Coe reporters."</seg>
<seg id="998">The whole Council and the entire Congress pleased that the Russian Federation has seen in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.</seg>

<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to reuse Russia again," "said Coe."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will be made for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make money loose, so that Neymar underwrites and brings him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be taxed with legitimate income sources, which enable them to break even the break even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively deceive and risked themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the club to monitor its losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - becoming a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP reporting period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs trying to overlook their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsor's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar's World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a maneuver could be easily determined for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to follow any attempt to bypass the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports indicate that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsorship contracts, merchandising and jersey sales."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss Life is looking for a new warehouse supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat Frey Board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the salute cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request by the news agency sda a report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman. "</seg>
<seg id="1165">"approximately 17 million small red-white packaged chocolate bags of 14 gram, each year, distribute the flight attendants to the passengers prior to landing."</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to" "Northwestern Switzerland" "to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss won't want to betray the number of applicants with the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"in question, however, only Swiss manufacturers come into question."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement."</seg>
<seg id="1173">"since 2006, Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights."</seg>
<seg id="1174">"before signing a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut has delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-th years, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Show alter the Sketch Comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels as if time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by sticking to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children, who will grow - nevertheless, they managed to regain the last part of the Witzes."</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adult, is less emotionally rooted and his parody takes more on the casting principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle." "</seg>
<seg id="1190">"one point sticks a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" a number of other things from 1991. ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the gracious coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">There is another mad-evil plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well sung impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the exams are the best part of the franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons sublippelling of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it is the moments of random delusion that this franchise could preheat like a repetitive" "Seven Up!" "series until he achieves what I see as his logical conclusion:" "hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", "whose last scene will show the gang, how they will visit the film premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer. ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"on Amazon," Comrade Detective "is reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by" The Americans, "on the film" Atomic Blonde "and even" GLOW "with its East-West wrestling iconography."</seg>
<seg id="1199">"the comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism."</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executing producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English are synced.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to look at (the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">"and the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice out'."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"but" Comrade Detective "is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan-mask, is involved - that it often plays like a single."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"with six long episodes, it is moving, and the comedy is not fast or often enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was adjusted to a lower length could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef are always attending the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Strike against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in making a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">"in the process, 15 defendants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"in the event of the same raids in Italy, two people were arrested."</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will probably be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">"in the event, Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved."</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, over 300 policemen were in use."</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the Mafia's members are accused of organised drug criminality, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organized drug trade in Southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large use was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo."</seg>
<seg id="1224">"in the course of the investigations, especially Italian nationals came to the Italian mafia with a close relationship to the Italian mafia."</seg>

<seg id="1227">"according to a report, the foreigner's register in Germany shows significant shortcomings."</seg>

<seg id="1229">"according to a media report, the Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, pointed out to large gaps in the immigration centre register."</seg>
<seg id="1230">"deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious misdecisions in the case of asylum procedures and deportations," warned the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" in an analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to data, the Register records ten million people with foreign nationality, including 5.7 million non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, data quality in parts has not been good."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data from 1921 have been found," "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens, and should no longer appear in the register."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"incorrect data entries can slow down reversal processes," says the report further. "</seg>
<seg id="1236">"in statistics on a sufficient number of people, EU citizens are also included, who would not have to travel at all."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false attributions, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate funding," stated in the analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children if they have been lodged there."</seg>
<seg id="1239">"this goes out of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" New Osnabrück Zeitung. ""</seg>
<seg id="1240">"therefore, in the paper it is said that BAMF is performing such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation dampened speculation on an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Bank's political decision makers (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 for holding the interest rates to 0.25%, with less members striving for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and by 2018 to 1.6% and warned against the pressure on domestic income, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that interest rates would be necessary over the next few years to bridle the inflation-heated inflation and she said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammoth economic package published one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper banks for banks from the upcoming February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burdened consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" slightly larger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases were" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts for this year and the next year are forecast to be 1.9% and 1.7% compared with the expected in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations for interest rate increase, and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will slightly recover after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases, as the tightening is even worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot" "prevent income", "but she added that the wages for the end of their three-year forecasts are" "clear". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"" "the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the fall of the Pact."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households, with three policymakers asking a rise to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2% was to be attributed to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders tend to look for shops and end the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is particularly good for those who run out the existing deals and complete the new mortgages, and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) should prescribe 10,000 people the disputed HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylaxis received prior to sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by healthcare through a first three-year study of estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS claimed the authority to pay for the prep despite claiming that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as an" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to make the registration of people possible and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those involved in the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants will be identified which agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt-in for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, which is specifically used, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed specifically on needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will soon be carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former Bankerin with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne stowage and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned architect and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to release the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metre number of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate investment</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation with the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"according to an agreement with her late father, Colin - Paul referred to as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin has a value of $316 million and Paul has a value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but proposes Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated dairy-bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jean shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says that he started Westco there when he was the High School in my last years, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass her property on to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark are, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin retired, although he was a former member of the AFL and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the TV star."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"Colin answered by SMS to say" I can't really say much, "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and to draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," "he said, adding that he still hopes for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: bad information that he got into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him," "said the former campaign manager Sam Nunberg against Politico in February."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"at the time, Politico Tara Palmeri wrote that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal consumption of media includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials are aware of something we don't know from others - that Trumps Tweet would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage to keep his anger away from him several times, then their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors, the president for strategic reasons, to supply dubious information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react to negative press releases like a volcano, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicans, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he voiced false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"he added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1432">"angry residents have pushed the council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by."</seg>

<seg id="1444">"at Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise"</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise becomes part of the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">They are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on 13 April 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue generated by the local tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collectible shelter, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the site of the hotel and already spoke of serious interest in the house back then."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with its head office in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof long time construction waste containers have been placed in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings are broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still much to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "nice bourgeois" "later on, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms wants to set up broadly, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, as Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to specify exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior systems are also brought to foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which is open to the restaurant, which is public."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. special educator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special educator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the panel has recorded the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to target themselves in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the Trump election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand who acted as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trumps private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special Agent Trump had personally moved into the center and searched for the accusation whether the President might hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible breakthroughs and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"Grand jurys, therefore, are also called the Counts of Indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on if they are larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to take part under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, pre-charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting had been invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"besides Trump Jr., Trump counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his dam leader Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the setting indicates that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he would react quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President of the Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The issue gives the democrats a possibility to "feel good" because they have nothing else they can talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His Special Advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn't know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, usually works in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he will not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rage, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has hindered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey said before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the National Security Advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affair around the later resigned president, Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move."</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators put draft bill on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfest."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"over a trillion t and 5800 square kilometre large Koloss is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melts."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant, which researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and aborts was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete missile file.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that even the Larsen-C-Shelf file is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can collapse if at a key point a piece breaks off."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and put ice as much water as it results after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glacier flows directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly raise sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iceplate is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argue whether the Larsen-C-Schelhagus will continue to grow again or go back long-term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these explorers did not return to climate change this gigantic iceberg, however, in the past few decades, however, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term needs for experts, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>

<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration should strive for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-related cities - a house tariff," said Peoples. "</seg>

<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organisation in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which will be delivered directly by traffickers and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer to monitor their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs active in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine willer bikers, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">"for this purpose, three friendly guides were available."</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Harvest of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were again and again longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival sausages market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"on the other hand, a view of the viewpoint, connected by" "flying" "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced again."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought low-willed breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers atmated healing Sole in the open-air-inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt has been controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - athletic and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga suits e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future rather than racing through the stadium ramps with wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-Sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also recognized the first federal ligades, which are increasingly involved in this area."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "there are several clubs coming up on this train." ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organized the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "in which the gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven are qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent electric sportsmen under contract, one could be present online more often on these markets than to send the Bundesliga to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sports, computer games such as" League Of Legends "," Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or just the football simulation of FIFA are fought at competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the 2022 World Cup, E-Sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobo has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and take care of the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, firobatics also sees problems:" doping is becoming more and more a topic. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"check-ups are difficult to perform on online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on their way around the world, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study conducted by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte counsellors write. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the Football League associations, according to Dutt, have meanwhile been obliged to set up an E-Sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany lags behind," explains VfB-CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to decay only in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitised world," writes Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years were exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free up to the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She ended his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter Attorney at law said it was a" "terrible circumstance" "which she totally regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read an explanation of Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all my pain we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit another committing suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring out of a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "Everything you have to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit by any press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended the Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 due to murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1690">That Joshua Kimme was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern thawns a big season to the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"something was different on his place in the cabin, that looked Joshua Kimme right away, even though the additional piece of clothing was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made himself a rush to his arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach has not announced it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first deployment as a Bavarian-captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the entry could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimme was able to interpret the sign of the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf's holiday makers, debutants and especially from holidays."</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is most likely to be distributed to those of whom you want a lot to keep in your mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">"those who were chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm, can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimme confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: assume responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flourished as a mini-undertook over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"to the right, this is his position, the white bandage on her arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kime seemed like the one who can best take the helm."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to steer the uncoordinated troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view for the whole, while many others were occupied with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"in doing so, Vidal resists his lack of fitness (foldable); Renato Sanchs wanted to make a stopover on the achievements of the Asia-trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not fall negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern Trikot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">But that worked quite well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süver ran along with Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli-storm was often difficult, in addition, Süle also tried a few times in the game-building a few times."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was" "not as we had hoped for." ""</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a decent performance during the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"game relocation, tempo change:" for this style, I was also brought up. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual this Bavaria-world is still for the newcomers, one saw in the connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determines six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimme said goodbye to some crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard from Süle an interesting sentence:" "what is going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"in Bavaria, you just have to win any game."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years, which in spring has caused a lot of rain and much more in autumn.

<seg id="1800">"there is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cids, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."</seg>

<seg id="1808">"Krämer, guilds, traders, vagaries or a land-scale camp are to be experienced in the inner city these days."</seg>
<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Rifuce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings range."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government or cartels payroll list, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while the corpses are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589, there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are its editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists are rarely tried by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Rifuce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is still more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we are distrust."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan province capital."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelfth river." ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kingships that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"remember for a minute that there is a state of" peace, "if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, there was the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was extradited to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Rifuce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without confronting the drug-poison problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Rifuce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead men... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rifuce team missed Valdez, the spawn-bird, who was able to curse like a doer, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the Rifuce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the employees of Rifuce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself said to be untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountains, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Rifuce has concentrated on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of brother of former well-known Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter heard of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption of high-calibre corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in whom a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped from a military raid."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers considered Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs, and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become speechless by laying down in organized protests" SOS Press "on walking paths and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked her to be re-classified by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an inappropriate society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media guard group" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas Cartel:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close how the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, announces that drug trafficking will frighten him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, so I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Rifuce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to hum."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with strip rivals and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the edge of the board, they published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are howling nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about closing," said Bojorquez, "If on the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used cloak to dodge his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue if also a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found out that the first insights of the incredible Nashore of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as" "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs". ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of an" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the subdued armored dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as" "truly remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earthclots."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this herbivorer, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-screening, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and soften its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shade is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by flesh-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful carnivorous behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores have to have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his conserved bowel content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea where he sank to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier really is remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved flaky skin, but also stays in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the subdued armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored herbivorous has been swept through the western Canada, until a flooded river flooding it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutest still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as" rare as winning the lottery. ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>

<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people crying, and of a man who claimed to be Browns father, who bore a shield with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried out," "I will kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the sort of murder we have gotten used to and that we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 11 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and of protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the happiness to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would do a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," "she said and noticed that she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"Ferrell asked a question:" do you want to document, or do you try to find a story you can take advantage of? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death-street inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, for this is how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement" is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life, as she falls in love with and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the dehumanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrara's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager by Martin in 2012, have marked the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement really is held upright by black women and many black women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmatical type of action "where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who fed up with this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though it was on the front line, because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a singing and she feels bound to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone divides the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," It would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a human being "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, the rest of which also benefit from the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct markets offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying almost every week in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always very gladly again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery settles in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should probably not be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping malls in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets, I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle will remain."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is inexpensive on top of that."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall go during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to drive all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and there is no need for a shopping centre, which is empty."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg have no place anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst made a 35-year prison sentence after publicly sponsored diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transnational and trailblazing dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg developed by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already openly talked about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison kept her picture suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, where Manning was obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette dumb and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned mice became too unequal spectacles, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a cartoon called" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo in which the president would translate the condemnation of Chelsea and she would be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama really was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of lucky coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for their oversized signature among them (the" i "in their surname is endowed with a heart) an end to" automatic dispersion, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with me is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free telephone in hand from the disciplinary courts of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they shut up your speech, they won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goose bumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as foreseen in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacons, which rally like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a country-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who were looked for as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) have issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the records of the District Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police agency of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the site of the event, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubesa, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem would now be subject to scrutiny and excluded from entering the campus of the Northwestern University."</seg>

<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that" "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he challenged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have a vision of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have stripped off their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"for this reason, the first three sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day when the brothers postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">"Mora said that he supported the regulation change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a novel novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Cloudy River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says in a melancholy way. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Swiiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were also there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") this all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena knobs on the walls and the bottles that had centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 than the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years when aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the times of English Empires, maps showing who had something:" you could think that land conflicts would be boring, "Rhodes says," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says. "</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest 'which tells the story of the Jesuit pater that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century who filled his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug up)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite crook, always pay debts and spend money on things that they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men quenched their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique screams"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults on retirees and promotions at the officer corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"the discussions took place under the chairmanship of the Government, now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Ministers."</seg>
<seg id="2344">"in this way, the civilians in YAS were in the number of survivors."</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government moves the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"the Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"since the coup failed, Prime Minister Erdogan 169 has fired up 169 of the 326 generals and admirals."</seg>
<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wireporter of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people who have been involved directly in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan was called a" "God gift" "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unease in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns because of an increasing" "Islamisation" "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the cover ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the major contribution to the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, by decree, Erdogan burned more than 7395 public servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan was taming the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals formerly considered the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they shared their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least in calling on the reform specifications of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is driving forward deliberately an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "an officer who was named after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad was waiting for the Turkish army to be" full of extremists and salafists in a few years. ""</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this is true, such a development could not leave Nato."</seg>

<seg id="2388">"the rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried"</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be crazier in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye-color to the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would let a stepper woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired of being fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (means: resisting) Farrah, fret one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy behaves with a vibrator on his website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxxy?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates the boundary zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time we live, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who praved to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn-out body and the filed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want them to feel human, that they mimic the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate yourself from your companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything, which might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the wisdom of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump."</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensily strive to burst out our filter bubbles.</seg>

<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet, who lives in Chicago, has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with whom she fought for decades for politics suddenly and very strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it seems to me that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the emanating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be aborted."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appears as a concept of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself being attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the New York Parks, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn around to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the limb music imparts this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel peak, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve emissions from emissions of Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesels or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smeteanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>

<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>

<seg id="2523">The first prize-giving ceremony on President Trump promises to become political.</seg>

<seg id="2526">"as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallad (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorable."</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">"traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Melania at the award ceremony."</seg>

<seg id="2530">"the New York Times said:" "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that bursts me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan insisted that she will use Trump to clarify her point of view.</seg>

<seg id="2536">"the place is already written, but suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker is a town-builder."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports about varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it makes it wonder that so far no application requirements fulfil the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, taking into account the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for training."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"as Haslach acts as a Lower House Legal Office for the Administrative Community, the applicant must present relevant degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg to advise."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity of citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between authority and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years of office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worthy of life," he is sure about the building office and its staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parking space for example have come across.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros," "if we do it right", "Wacker appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in design, there is great scope for a city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs's own yard and landscaping, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what is in place "when new buildings are approved, emphasises the retiring city building master."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the City Builder bears high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything runs over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes himself:" we are looking for someone who wants to really identify and stay with the place. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who would like to be buried by Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed degree in architecture as a diploma engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of building and building planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad track in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) to the leaderships."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, a rose-scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausannoystreich," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch on the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have brought themselves into danger themselves and also jeopardized the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail transport, the culprits could also come to the culprits."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway track could be guided without a handicap."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"just under ten persons, Friday morning had dropped out, two of them related to the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains were not cancelled, but they had delayed."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products may alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet tolerant to tryptophan favours less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also affects humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that fostered tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but it had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria appeared to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells dropped by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us are protesting L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2606">"the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last high season game before the UEFA Super Cup kicks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder's role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will."</seg>

<seg id="2624">"only no fire-fire from the party centre, merely no headwind from the Confederation, was the most important wish of the election warriors."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus are watching events in the SPD-governed state capitals."</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwinds.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were precipitation.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one by one.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"following the surprising ending of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this once again shows: red-green can simply not be reliable," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising faction of a Greens deputies overthrew the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the Parliament elections, its red-green coalition consequently lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-German business leader Michael Kellner has called on the backsliding Saxon Greens Euro MP Elke Tests to give back her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tests must immediately return her mandate," "said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true at all," an SPD election fighter groans, when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without its own government majority after the overstepping of the green deputies Elke Tvests."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser started with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, not more, the comrades were soothed at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"it was then, and indeed, everything became much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into picket, the Düsseldorf-Pleite beat the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades strove again in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just picked up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next setback.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD governor, lost his nicity on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he made everything wrong with what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">"since then, Scholz has been fighting for its political survival."</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been criticised for some time now."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miological survey data were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"nevertheless, or perhaps because of that, Weil always tried to set accents in the Confederation during the past few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, too, remained unconcealed in the environment of Martin Schulz."</seg>
<seg id="2657">"they let him grant him, as they spoke of Weil a stabilization of the party."</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"in doing so, Weil is basically no fault with the party-internal compulsion of the Lower Saxon Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz did not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"for the time being, comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is aimed at the Greens, and above all on the backsliding parliamentarian vests."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is intolerable and democratic as Mrs. Tests puts her own career starters on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Mrs. Tvests has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but has been elected to Parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxon Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains of an" "undemocratic manoeuvre". ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters" willingness four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister, "says Oppermann, who is leading the Lower Saxon SPD as a leading candidate in the German Bundestag election, the RND."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now the personal career of a future CDU deputies falsifies the election result," "said Oppermann."</seg>

<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military's specifications left to the TIME magazine up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi, the helicopter was built in Connecticut."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of the helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, the deputy commander of the naval aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message was that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"at the disposal of the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act promises to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commander."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," "the deputy commander answered."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to demand their use only for photo-surgery is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump carried out an investigation, when the president's plane landed in the background of his first Kampagnenrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy spokesman of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"HMX-1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn, in order to reduce the US president in the White House with precise centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercise landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event was one of the training needs of the crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, Helikopter units flew 11 hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers did not take charge of any of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 has no budget labels for the presidential ploughs, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for VH-3D amounts to 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">The unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to highlight this.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump had been interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour through the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joking with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence against the cathedral-cats with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the encroachments in Regensburg, no one doubted that it would be" shameful and shameful deeds, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "writes Scarenia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and this is a stained glass.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows were a quite normal pedagogical means" "to cope with cheeky children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they found it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse incidents, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely unjustly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger, wrote the memory book" "My brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he analyses the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it can be said that by master master R. R. in many cases physical and psychological violence were used. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be heavier."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, hesemann explained why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it appears as a choline and perfectionist, which was hand-grasped by the latter, when a domain-set musically did not bring top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can pretend to experience it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedristic gymnasium on which it worked was felt by practically all respondents as - literally" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony," sincere, "" sincere, "" sincerely, "as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to eruptions."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not just knead with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also pulled ear-figs and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself already admits to years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to be honourable, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period, the 1960s and the 1970s, in parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, those are Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his notoriety and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many people who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the media reported a lot about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or co-ordination with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault contends to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in the education of sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even trust their parents and siblings, certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the role of Ratzinger's Domspatzen? s Role in view of the abuse incidents?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and would have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it is absurd to assume that it is just absurd to assume that... more penetrable or clearer or even more open than in relation to their parents, dormitories, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" "that the students and / or their surroundings confided in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak about any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not preventing him or having brought him to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to link up his good name with these contradictory crimes, as happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violence excesses" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former master kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Perspectives."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogics, the cases in which the children of sadistic teachers were literally victimized and maligned and suffered, all happened at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boy when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the subject of" "preschool". ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but there was no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore combine positive memories with him in numerous cases despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the accusation remains to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which the states were reported to him at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear, and then only back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out," that in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practised. ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test fines had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the persons affected might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria from Thurn und Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "fallout of anachronism", "so the danger of evaluating past past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and not for what was banished in the pre-school of resistances and violence against innocent children's souls."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing, therefore slap the ear and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, it was also strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image of his time of Regensburg has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of the sentence also speak to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective, as the Domspatzen plays only a side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not mention that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trance, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone, one does not even make a big vocalist and before every success, right in which area, yet always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"what kind of people have you, Georg Ratzinger, have seen in the talks about her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, heartfelt, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could do something like a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get contact with him, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look up and revere."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: all that one proposes to him are educational methods which were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stop command would stop, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
