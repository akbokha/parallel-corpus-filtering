28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; he went up again . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations on running are .
&quot; brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared with the ABS Sender K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , took his dream job as cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived at Host@@ els at first , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to connect his way with his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of conflict .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond who sh@@ one brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the round @-@ out of the SF@@ PD using the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always stuck in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ uous in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or I get stuck with the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress spends her time at home , pre@@ m TV with loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for white glu@@ t they bring the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us starting on 25 August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses had remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted back home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career ended up again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses . &quot;
he had his family run over the AL@@ RV &apos;s facility . he was not even photograph@@ ing a horse for a photo .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help handed the man from An@@ hausen the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid as part of a small gala .
it doesn &apos;t lack the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; silver Lor@@ rel leaf , champion @-@ tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen already sw@@ elled him .
the 18th award winner of the sports pyramid is a long one .
he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for athle@@ tic success , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent .
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US @-@ Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the champion Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the rider Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sporting legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept his distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to avoid this .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental rather philosophical difference .
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; in the case of doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep it small and warn against how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely reti@@ re on regulations , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and it needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in order to invest in this , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ dy . &quot;
the democratic candidate den@@ oun@@ ces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the re@@ public@@ ans by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp , there could still be partial @-@ party discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and drive coal mining in the United States .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement he wants to cancel . &quot;
&quot; with its investment programme , Clinton specifically wants to expand renewable energy and demand : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ osi@@ tive trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid even better , for example , Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to get up , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
his critics cont@@ end him so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to demand the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
flight : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is for women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ ready @-@ bred women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence in her flight , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are pursued politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hop@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away from it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is what drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , mis@@ lead , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the Munich north , traumati@@ zed , estimated them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they experienced , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodation just for them , ask B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in the accommodations of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fl@@ ushed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own houses for single women and their children in some communal dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing , men and women are lod@@ ged together , it can lead to perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this need of protection can be read by the rush , which is placed on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work campaigns
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more working conditions from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; had to pose problems , which led the contract to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC committee voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations on all your worries . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to assistance physicians of this year struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A Assistant Doc@@ tors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that were advised by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 veter@@ in@@ arians and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot for@@ bid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow @-@ li@@ pped and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if it had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm rather seemed to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to remember . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was ramp@@ ant .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
it was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
setting up the trust will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all .
the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month in a failed state coup . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ hr@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , because it &apos;s reaction to the attempted sei@@ zure of power as a weak response . &quot;
the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus for claiming that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course , which even has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; once described by an analy@@ st : two countries that are viol@@ ating from the West , and are badly treated and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once more . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s board of directors , the R@@ BS label should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan condemned the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations ru@@ g@@ by up to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , headquarters and stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer run its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the accept@@ ability of the different brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the board . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ vent@@ ing , trained by John Gos@@ der on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ er when he brings victory to Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the steep@@ le ch@@ ase - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enthusiastic about this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he would have fet@@ ched 6.000 gains if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ger@@ min@@ ated nearly 30 years of winning in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole row of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to an end yet - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his least fifty years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin hum@@ idi@@ fied Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his chief of staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence of Putin many years ago .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Opport@@ unities .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating grounds , Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it reads ( in Russian ) that later he was the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer of the government personnel . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state in law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ caster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest friends of Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ ig@@ ns on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile on the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president at once would want to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust your posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most . &quot;

ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that with the 75 fish , there could be sand whales that were blown out by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope , hoping someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the square , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine cables . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
economics Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , nearly 79 % of the total deck deck is in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project is the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the North Tower , we had to close the existing gap to the north or the north . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
&quot; the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after having been thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI ambul@@ ance station turned on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Al@@ ert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty going to swim , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and introduced us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we let water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this was released by the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
someone has watched these men today .
seriously injured - A man catches up on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ driven perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building off @-@ priced apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens think : in future investors should be taken much more into duty .
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next council session , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; housing concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it &apos;s about the question : who should build cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future exhibit 20 percent of all housing as social housing . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also be built in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing as possible . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction program , which will cost millions of costs and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; regardless of it , so Brat@@ mann , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how can one reconci@@ le the loss of other around 1300 budget apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this from happening , the planning politi@@ cian Nicole Palm should now buy out @-@ of @-@ date links from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; because in the western city , Fri@@ sten are running at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price connection for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; since the number of social housing in the western city is increased again dr@@ astically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; said S &amp; D leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go to the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand sank in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries has been shifted by massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the bar@@ ge and jumped to find the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person reco@@ vers every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app that followed 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the game &apos;s market launch , the number of subsequent people who exercise 30 minutes every day , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes time to come &quot; from the sofa and &quot; to be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ eling addic@@ ts who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it like ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will let up with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active , suppor@@ ter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget about the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast opened on Thursday for a multiple battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team captain A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ net@@ h on the floating beam during the single multi@@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and in total the fifth , while she is holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the sport of sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected it to be a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi@@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ an insi@@ sted that during her long way to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school flight in the Turn@@ halle , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition competition , a winning series that will last for as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture clou@@ ded . &quot;
ho@@ vering beams and floor pits - in which Bil@@ it holds the world title - lau@@ tered .
&quot; she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her grand@@ ma - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed bril@@ li@@ antly on bil@@ es bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of the team , which is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercise she threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ an is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass murder case when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ made fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y accident , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic homes within four months and two more injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; reported Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found bul@@ let sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the few of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund has Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled down on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I did not know that people still make , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; Please sing something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life associated with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional award of an uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their shores and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , agreed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increased . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inch ra@@ ins could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that an up@@ stream @-@ downward flow in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , since these rivers are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Lim@@ its in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still be@@ headed people from the flood water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by the Glo@@ be on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his home , rose strongly over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that he had warned him of another son &apos;s son , who lives nearby . &quot;
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high elevation of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members all had disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; spreading rapidly , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer approached Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was well balanced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and teaching failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that a senior in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches which were now both flooded .
&quot; the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets that were washed by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , there were emergency shel@@ ters to house the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood of flood and sand bags for the inhabitants were provided , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison count@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded but on Friday , no reports have been reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets &quot; survi@@ ves sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he did a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , t@@ apped the scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly a struggle that lasted for a long time .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were sleeves . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also met in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ill at the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catholic , rounds off everyone . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ W@@ inner and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who won gold in an individual multi@@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport , but so turn classes do not look out all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to put it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; however , the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and turns Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer to the municipalities of innumerable , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible exercise training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated you to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance physicians want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7th resident physicians who voted for election rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would find itself in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be detri@@ mental to any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
the first Doc@@ tors will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend bites to improve care at un@@ attended times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance physicians told last night in a message saying : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and it will be administered to treat all physicians appropriately . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by discussions have met with the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes silence @-@ num@@ bing silence .
this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the concerns of assistance physicians . &quot;
&quot; if he should not do so , the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further employment measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide coverage for doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance physicians to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working conditions do not reach anything but little , but already burden over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , care@@ gi@@ vers and their families to worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the assistant of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education , and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 per day medicine that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ul@@ ant drug Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing the flow of blood to the heart causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another .
&quot; Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots less prob@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the line design of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ in@@ Rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing other heart attacks and strokes among people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ in@@ Rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ in@@ Rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture boo@@ sts electoral fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office for corruption due to corruption &quot;
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread dis@@ mis@@ sal in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally acc@@ esses the police , election observers and town halls for ignor@@ ing the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now a slave @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of elec@@ tors from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside of bal@@ lot boxes to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters must carry out a reference to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they vote their vote , in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial structure that accompanies it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was supposed to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including driving out evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence has been attached that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi context . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; in@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists edit stamp papers to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone chooses twice .
conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists edit full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of post @-@ elections .
the police have the authority to set up barriers for elec@@ tive stations .
a change in the law that facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation under the People Act 1983 ( Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , in order to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters alone go to the election cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; check@@ ups &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court case at Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come to this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , out of the border and band , which proved to be an impressive double competitor to the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to compete for gold ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy announced the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ companion for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
&quot; one step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair , like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the similarities as well .
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face @-@ form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; departed &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; ief &quot; &quot; and died during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he released his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m cycle lif@@ egu@@ ard .
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost touch , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , retired as low , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers throughout Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ed , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost touch , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter quickly and hard on which many presented him

&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast on a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who answered B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter

we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers for broadcast and our followers in social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald was ap@@ olog@@ ising in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ires about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the midst of business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued rum@@ ma@@ ging and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and went shopping without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the outside , pulled her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she liked nothing and went out and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b her that she watched someone - or think about the person who might buy under certain circumstances the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants off home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; David Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out and she was not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products that come into question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to rotate the spe@@ ar for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when approaching from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; move out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er sp@@ lashes out of pain , the weapon is out of his hands . hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; at attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but keep in mind that it is the saf@@ est thing to make your money over - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ uts down his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ nour@@ ished his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test by li@@ king some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a Euro note , a rail@@ ings at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pull @-@ in button of a pull @-@ in toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before finishing each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of leak@@ age the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull @-@ on toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked out , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to dish@@ washing of toilets , the task was to defini@@ tively put its immune system under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial finish showed a lumin@@ ometer score of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their lumin@@ ometer number was more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That comes closest to the worst thing I have dug in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dis@@ cour@@ aged than that !
I &apos;m not gon@@ na stop here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have checked out some of the things that I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to leak and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of ga@@ stro and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social home after a dele@@ tion with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative &apos;s shocked employees found the property in an irre@@ parable situation . &quot;
&quot; the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , working for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way .
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror that the family had added was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , nar@@ cot@@ ics of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , quar@@ rels and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were traded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gated her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , waste and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a dele@@ tion is always the last step , considering Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed after having found himself guilty of possession of a drug of class B in commercial custody .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police says they will del@@ o@@ ze tenants who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the dele@@ tion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without deduc@@ tions , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after flying an air @-@ eff@@ ected military jet beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air forces put an unbelievable storm back
&quot; air strikes stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ res@@ cent jet goes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up , understand@@ ably beginning to worry about the noise of the din@@ osau@@ rs , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the speaker said that the jet flew lower than usual due to bad visibility due to bad visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people on the island of Madeira to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke smoke , which narrow@@ ed his view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise

&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must ren@@ ounce the qualifying with the under@@ stated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who in Brazil cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the request was clari@@ fied at Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen race in Barcelona for two years now for the status as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique has so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league but T@@ er St@@ egen is the preferred candidate in most other applications .
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness condition of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 at the Pro@@ fici@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. had not really known yet .
&quot; Sevilla , on the other hand , has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Espa@@ ña . &quot;
&quot; with up to now eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided final .
&quot; in doing so , the world rank@@ ings first received the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to finish the final game as expected and made the title of each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and time @-@ outs , they had no coaches . &quot;
they had withdrawn from the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were pos@@ ing with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang with a total of 13 points . &quot;
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless enough breathtaking ball@@ ots were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russians pulled a rib@@ bed final , after that in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have also become similarly high table tennis in Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp cle@@ ars ″ massive problems ″ in election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states . &quot;
the presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now had weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually appears large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , such as concerns expressed , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within his own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ aming false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
w@@ ack@@ ers of republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard in June , Tru@@ mp and his competitor of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton , were alike . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the radio station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will &quot; be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot;
he does nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party has threatened to raise funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present better demand values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to get stronger under arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympic Games : three Sc@@ am in the D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the storm after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Games Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer at home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee agreed to promptly set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations and reported an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will perform an assessment , &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed over and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed the sports@@ men of his country about forthcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls laid out by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result WA@@ DA took from the list of countries , whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations that are easily accessible in Kenya are easily accessible and there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und last requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport @-@ type was widespread and systematic . &quot;
Russia athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare @-@ Jahr , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
this is a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical to the classical temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members sad@@ ness to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli men@@ tions the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in every one of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the dolls have gone to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ j@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was alleged that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people stop making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from east London entered a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and , within a few months , became a widow . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of election victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats will nom@@ inate H@@ illary Clinton the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Tribunal for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the nom@@ ination of Gar@@ lands , be lack@@ eys and Hel@@ per Workers of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .

the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked human beings , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distingu@@ ishable as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
it seems that it is the calendar also doing .
&quot; we must return to portra@@ y timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and lo@@ oms himself , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of asylum seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh secret of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with sanctions several months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the iced put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would still be added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of the Association demanded that the Federal Government positions itself &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition parties . &quot;
the br@@ anding of the Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ar , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper referred to figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior reports , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised by political persecution even before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all have been eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there are no prisoners of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum enti@@ t@@ lements according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because more stupid than before , it does not matter : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day elections - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election champi@@ ons , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so must not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes in the end , only work ti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ du@@ sting .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spreads roses and ch@@ ats a little chat with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for Af@@ D &apos;s thri@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create , &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its Spitzen@@ kan@@ di@@ daten , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if one turns into the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to open meetings ; Merkel &apos;s federal elections lie in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , according to co@@ ca@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the countryside you have to crum@@ ble the base , so that it has to work very hard once again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the vast expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Co@@ co@@ ert to his comrades is , however , self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats la@@ gged at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday times and largely lay their electoral campaigns on the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on a search for local stimul@@ ants among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , goes straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is san@@ iti@@ sed .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and ending only at 8 pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the subject is also commen@@ ded to the construction of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been abol@@ ished , and therefore the link to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fan@@ dy@@ nia from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy head office manager Florian King , responsible for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach &apos;s Street , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many scar@@ path@@ ways were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some lor@@ ry was fran@@ ch@@ ised in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were also not observed , the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; King says , who made himself clear about the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been infl@@ ated .
the fastest speed was 77 kilometers per hour in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment of them has led to revenue bur@@ sts , everyone you ask has to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er , but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; the leak is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the inn@@ s have &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue is &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road marking has been dis@@ car@@ ded &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages of the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now see less frequently due to complicated transport , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his family @-@ kli@@ fts come back at the end of the renovation work .
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being screw@@ ed on . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , Minister of the Interior , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , now presents a large security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other additional points would first be discussed within the parties .
&quot; also , I took part in this . &quot;
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on air passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come as a surprise .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double nationality the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which in the coalition partner doesn &apos;t have any chances anyway . &quot;
&quot; a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , too . &quot;
they have partially in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for incar@@ cer@@ ating people before deportation .
refugees who are specifically brought to the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the event of toler@@ ances for expi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to face some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or intentionally throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are politically and legally heated .
some of them still work un@@ polished and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in the face of the high refugee population , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things , which people deeply occupied , could not be cl@@ ut@@ ched even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has enormously moved into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Union and SPD are increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ sty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Ministers , in which the department leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he thinks of a departure from a double pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
it does not make sense to re@@ charge you .
&quot; and in the case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has obj@@ ection@@ able obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and if it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , only has to show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things that could cause stri@@ fe .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ mul@@ gate internal security . &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further improve security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel locom@@ oti@@ ves , the delivery numbers rise worldwide . &quot;
but not all markets are running smoothly .
&quot; during the recall campaign , there is a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start the second half @-@ year when deliveries are delivered .
&quot; thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can further forward a further plus despite the diesel stock market thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the core brand VW declined especially in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sale , as reported by the company listed in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , accounted for 14 percent of the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth . &quot;
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s sales director Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker numbers in July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase restra@@ int due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot;
the Chinese market is a big support for VW .
&quot; all in all , the main target of the Lower Saxony &apos;s primary brand will continue to be lightly reported by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Head of Sales , Fred Kap@@ pler , continued to present a sales division . &quot;
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen was manipul@@ ated with a software release .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car maker will issue a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason for this is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal refin@@ ement .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now making a guarantee for its German customers , however , a guarantee of re@@ inde@@ er diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW had to fulfil the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterior@@ ations will take place in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and all the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the indul@@ ging sc@@ andal may result in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future criminal proceedings - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , bank chief Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only around 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers must &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their p@@ olls . &quot;
&quot; if banks are depos@@ iting money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee ear@@ ns the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the future , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he has jumped 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the next , and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and generate a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; said the Chief of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4,000 euros . &quot;
he now continues the cost according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
&quot; just leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and ex@@ changing to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria explained , &quot; The extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; &quot; economically sustainable &quot; &quot; not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their bank charges , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with penalty for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the Banking Union said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay surface fees for deposits , but competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is more luxuri@@ antly furnished by fortune . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if it cost money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , concluded at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany won &apos;t let this happen in the l@@ atitude .
Dest@@ ination Records : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men of medium @-@ old love plates .
&quot; before you come to the comment section to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of Non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ ene Men &apos;s Middle Ages with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of gram@@ ophone records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but can be attributed to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , keeping a humble gray suit and saying something like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of medium age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approximately 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , rev@@ et the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records which he could not afford , when they appeared and again sold items which he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers , who he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took offen@@ se on the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar gram@@ ophone envel@@ opes , from objects that evoke happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a stack . &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
&quot; the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I plan@@ ing through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player .
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly entering . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ist Pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ra@@ vel when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she is more of a window @-@ shopping than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of panel lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I preten@@ ded to dis@@ courage the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for lux@@ uries such as plates . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which carry a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for assign@@ ing people who run 72 provisional shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; &quot; absolutely trac@@ eable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated in a communal manner and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids &apos; café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite the Olympic Games : Martin is still fighting

here comes the reinforcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , the tem@@ pos@@ esses should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers from the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary heating , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationary gl@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days in case of un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be detected at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits and access b@@ ans according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mode , the trailer can be fitted with a trailer coupling according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear with a shot @-@ proof outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic data in various federal states and has now also been used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash@@ ed with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain picks up silver in 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ point Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
&quot; Fiji granted a class class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ing , back @-@ back , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal in any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fiji had beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for the UK - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sevilla under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this key will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji started wonderful and had fun crashing out G@@ Bs .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with another four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner , which he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ook@@ y T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has stopped Fiji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the second time and there was still about a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ cl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning to play . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB executed fundamental changes at the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tou@@ red Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant clip of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ ans whose fans sang , flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB cr@@ ushes crushed in the grass . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ ali@@ ere gold as these games and that will mean something .
&quot; from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go down into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the tail , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic champion in a second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ interrupted use , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes floating over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of trium@@ ph@@ al ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and no one was more helpful than the coach who didn &apos;t know about 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed with cancer this day . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is operated and they did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was fortunate that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which kept interrup@@ ting to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ moving morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain at the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thanks to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity taken care of
&quot; the Managing Director of the Water Training Association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was named after a while in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the forced con@@ voy . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband associate , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes around 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 locations and Wei@@ ler with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are municipalities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency missions on weekends &quot; , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and there were always new additions , because water is the most important food and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her speech , Gö@@ ll@@ ers lau@@ ded faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has settled the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful companion .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well as well as the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on 3 January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because you filled the high tank from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and injured them deadly .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him , he was publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; by now , Sven S. could travel by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; it is , however , a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the Ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to eye witnesses , a special er@@ ecting command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional cost in million@@ aires .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from the oil flow promotion are from the table .
&quot; the German Steel Industry Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; as a result , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies . &quot;
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
&quot; as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emission trading market , &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation further intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw iron on the world market in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers submit price dump@@ ing to Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a bit . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties were imposed on import steel , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China were brigh@@ tened up . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ant again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent lower crude steel than in the prior @-@ year period , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the gathered quantity returned for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp &apos;s whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German Senior league . &quot;
&quot; most of the sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; thanks to regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve at the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak up and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of unity . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; because of this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life .
&quot; when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher significance ; it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers are sin@@ king into long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially elderly people who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem increases also by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby shouldn &apos;t delay - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many towns also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as males at cries of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the litter of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of cat babies in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te by k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary School of Medicine and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) found out . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young are either non @-@ percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the author of the study , published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; journal . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a lit@@ te of small children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; all the females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cries , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when the loop of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Bar@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch @-@ riv@@ als between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be impaired when the exception occurred after the fall of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
it does not stop even before football .
&quot; against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days until October , the fact that most Turks did not have any effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; democracy guards &quot; at public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; traditionally , fans of the &quot; &quot; Tro@@ ik@@ tas &quot; &quot; club are not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot;
&quot; however , what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Gala , &quot; &quot; it will be time to arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g there was only one rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for master mani@@ acs , the year of the game was better . &quot;
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ keeper King , laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in spite of the political situation in the country after the attempted coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , who was under contract with AC @-@ Florence under contract and decided not to return due to the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wishes to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man cited . &quot;
&quot; but in order to do this , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to wai@@ ve around a third of his annual estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man pointed out : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals of medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over@@ hau@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they &apos;re fighting in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock caught her start right before the games , was bl@@ otted out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
it offered a bizarre scene : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still stum@@ bled into the hall and provoked her appearance .
&quot; when she saw that she would not get gold , the audience burst out into a jubil@@ ee storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed twice for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champi@@ ons even faster than before , he is the world &apos;s number one more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 , after having proved the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship has been positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement was responsible .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had detected so many medals at a later stage . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title due to testosterone deficiency .
&quot; in 2008 , the Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ ad@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games was rec@@ alled due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CA@@ S . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold favourite was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications were found for taking a forbidden food supplement , the lock of World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she has suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home@@ ward journey at the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ating near the beach in Pat@@ ong which was popular with holiday@@ makers .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed before the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself on possible motives , but probably it is the action of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed of the exact time and place . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instructed their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always some smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the new bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary journeys to these provinces are dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
increased security risk ( Level 2 ) applies for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the Military Un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , will benefit himself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; according to several national offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement too . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; the loss of one &apos;s own identity by comm@@ itting adul@@ tery . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; during the decision , Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the local offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience where they stand , &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
that is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I don &apos;t have any findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point onwards . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - will change its direction and become extrem@@ ist by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the substantial increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ g said he would not speak of new right terrorism . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be legitimate @-@ frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it can be quite possible that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups are forming to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene were concerned .
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum cases were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many persons have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by far @-@ right wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always are the Olympic Games or World Records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia flo@@ ats so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV images . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in the social networks , Hab@@ te then became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a delay of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games nevertheless ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
&quot; as most athletes run in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs , I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
fast the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; following a &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ail &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made fun of it with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to go on alone in a course of more than 100 metres . &quot;
&quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .
a seat in the front row for the stunning architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles
&quot; learn more about the history of the central library in the city center , as the Society of Archit@@ ec@@ tural Change / Southern California Chapter holds a Salon with Arnold Schwar@@ tz@@ man and Stephen Ge@@ e , the authors of the new book &quot; Los Angeles Central Library : a History of its Art and Architecture . &quot; &quot;

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the new place has been tax@@ ed .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left her business on Monday at 5 : 30 pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back at 8.@@ 15 pm the next morning , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;

Tru@@ mp does not look so close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks about a campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp will lose US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will work either , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t enough for him for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , there was , in the end , more and more resistance . &quot;
mail rises in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; soon , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; said a post office spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed street sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other farms . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ d had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group soon wants to enter mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ factory manufacturing process , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wants to significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars , and to ensure a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we reloc@@ ate the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership comes after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the cuts came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the corporate leadership the worldwide number Five of the industry faces a new beginning .
GF@@ RP Executive Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
&quot; as early as 1 September , the management board of the Executive Board has handed over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ gger , a member of the Executive Board . &quot;
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found .
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; differing views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details did not want to call a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; in the future , who will be leading the market research company in the future , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago would have been great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the recently bad business figures , each shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the first half of the year , sales decreased by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was above all imp@@ acted by the lower value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the good@@ will depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , posted a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line . &quot;

&quot; in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , told the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which was partly on the opposite track . &quot;
the bus came right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of sewage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ zen@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sur@@ ging calculation , the wastewater fee in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household through the municipal council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that these wastewater facilities are running under cover . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Casino market is oblig@@ ated to operate the plants on a cost @-@ covering basis . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ z@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the board , a re @-@ calculation of fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be equ@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; the serious charges increased by Schmidt with the fact that there were relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack on all three sewage plants , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water flow in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period in all three plants , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses were not least noticed in all three plants due to their age . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , added to this , was spar@@ ed the market community of large entertainment costs in the sewage plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater association could not be extended because they are defici@@ ent . &quot;
Bulgaria up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual mean fl@@ ation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , that is , the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remain as in the previous month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect has been critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can transform into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ flowering , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mistakes are made to the public .
snap@@ shots have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of creating black face promoting or propag@@ ating white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose tweet about the photos was widespread , that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and said to say &quot; &quot; unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the descending extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be expected to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed most of the white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Snap@@ chat mostly un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer focused on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence , Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; the military personnel of the United States Central Command changed the intelligence information to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual state of affairs had been allowed on site , reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Defence Committee , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and the Defence budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , which were typically de@@ cent@@ red by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the manag@@ erial errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ l could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s peaks changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; gave the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; sh@@ amed the mor@@ ale under analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have resor@@ ted to re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State commemor@@ ates the inter@@ acts of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker declared that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional oil refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger orders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US gains fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday in India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever having done that . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , she knows that the Americans lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 seats . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey club in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , at the age of 16 she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympic Games in 2008 as she could not qualify for the squ@@ ad .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things to a better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the US Army &apos;s go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book one goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling steady and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock of dimples , could well have been among these well known names that would have been sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may it reign long .
&quot; but if I have enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so spar@@ sely perceived that many that I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year .
&quot; the jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a earth @-@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending up@@ swing - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; upcoming winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad , they are evaluated according to the performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in her quest for gold med@@ alli@@ ons must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but in the tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission also another highlight destination : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the targeted aspir@@ ation is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel when watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a contest here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and final results will take place on Friday afternoon , at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time streaming ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block from 2 p.m. onwards .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ gling and the objective enhancement of male ath@@ lets , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people flo@@ cked on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on all un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now requires a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the country &apos;s most popul@@ ous country in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism through the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options out of protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ co , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold with respect to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den which in recent years were more or less forced to take advantage of the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of falling under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians committed themselves to the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered mainly in Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too changes .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ let Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , domin@@ ating around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was sentenced to 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ urely reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region in northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to analysts had apparently been fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked from Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ean flights over the neighbouring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she had concluded this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin line of grass . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS to be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
&quot; it also brings forth his comrades who make an effort to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , to explain in the peculiar position , statements he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having made the announcement of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was calling back to claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant that the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism le@@ ashes down to Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton were talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course , I meant sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more estimated tone since its demand values decreased . &quot;
&quot; a new pol@@ l from N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general tried not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent advocate , made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , questioning Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ bro@@ ker , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out aggres@@ sively to control the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied with him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked about Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store have been sup@@ planted . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2014 , the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie store selling soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time staff of old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new out@@ sole , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same Distribut@@ or for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ris@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ tioned onions . &quot;
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regul@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also forced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb shut down , she gave a while to coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long time and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I arrived fourth after seven , every day like a s@@ wis@@ s pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business had taken hold of the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ point have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill and sell cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the president Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a dessert of pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; the latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash of 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered mushroom fr@@ ying , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the roads with which the country was surrounded , no longer to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when the food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; declared Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became the stap@@ le food that K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le recovered as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food residue &quot; , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
strange mixtures were tried out because a high @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction took preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy food .
&quot; while resear@@ ching for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continued : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the family recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - like the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge of turning pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historic delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Far@@ ming cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ wei@@ ghted man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully alien to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example of his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the arrival of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes caused by Ms. Roosev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; at the writing of the book , the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind blow incident .
&quot; after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roosev@@ elt did at noon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was an ordinary trick to miss a send name . &quot;
&quot; there was no cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ gs a bit reluct@@ antly , a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even at a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into play to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help them in the war zone first aid .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil defence , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; he never saw himself as a hero , but he said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the genuine Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland has only 150 years of birth .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a pattern for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist has long argued that Greenland &apos;s hair is st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter . &quot;
researchers know accordingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
they measured six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
&quot; this sh@@ arks still make prey : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt asleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , that tor@@ so from higher water @-@ layers down . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest size is 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably high carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus .
&quot; therefore , their birth should lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try to lower large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers of length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons trials , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in their l@@ enti@@ ls , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the old record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , where a 120 @-@ year old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck on the neck , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame . &quot;
they mature then later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
for the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal bu@@ ys warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more danger@@ ously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more in a long life . &quot;
construction site in double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the Municipal Council has dealt with heavily in the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board took up the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently identified areas of living space can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the plots of land , par@@ cel@@ li@@ fication and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the moti@@ ons were to be sur@@ vey@@ ed , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is no longer in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and old sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , building consent can immediately announce themselves in the town hall , about the allocation of the plots the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also request requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to modify the newly created land @-@ usage plan that was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; accordingly , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; to date , approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
these are taking advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts 10,000 new jobs on the River Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is addressing the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities like the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg does a large fund industry , however , as well as Dublin , it is worse in infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine River , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main River . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked seventh , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot;
&quot; London , however , will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , the econom@@ ist . &quot;

a U.S. National Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead stood , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck ens@@ la@@ ve each other and claimed property on laboratory work that Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir added , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops backed by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops backed by the US have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently comb@@ ing the rem@@ nants of the remaining group of fighters , which have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council , allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of State Bill Clinton expressed an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false statements and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ visor said to CN@@ N that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tru@@ mp critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , donations for charitable organisations , his business partners and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday , calling on the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she talked about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politicians reported that during the 1990s , during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor of War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average annual tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of 2015 clin@@ ton showed that this is only USD 100 related to their income as wage , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and returns of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ zers ; fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , has intensified its promotion by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Trade Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air . &quot;
a touch rather tends to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a gol@@ fer who shoots a fire@@ work fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;
city council votes unanim@@ ously : no neo @-@ neo @-@ neo @-@ construction at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects of commercial traders with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - particularly the retail trade in the core city - is considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales camp on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river . &quot;

Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after announ@@ cing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as it had requested Arab guests according to an employee .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list . &quot;
&quot; the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to select Israel from its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; cho@@ cked him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it arous@@ ed more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election will be er@@ ased , &quot; said the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large response from the Internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given to the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; feel ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident &quot; &quot; See &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to not include Israel in the electoral list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police places tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to diver@@ t the students apart , leading to the fact that the police put on rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was reli@@ eved of his vocation by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade exchange between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared with the Russian ambassador in Iran . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , distributed the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the Trading Division was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , Russian foreign representation issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage em@@ ark@@ et inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was committed at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had covered their faces , demanded the release of cash from the drink em@@ ark@@ et and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage store is directly accessible and poorly visible from the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators must be scann@@ ed in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert way and from the gravel parking space lying in front of the park entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have been observed in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun in summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ educational daily group / social group work of the child protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer vacation in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet , secluded outdoor village Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the lively group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to b@@ ail with the visit of the string z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous Monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days , the group visited the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; children and care@@ gi@@ vers have been treated to culinary delights with their own homemade desserts such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops it has been cur@@ ated , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings by the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ ance journey of all the stran@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the top @-@ of @-@ chief of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage immigration . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the dioc@@ es@@ an city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Fr . Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and par@@ ted pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where a minster of Our Lady stands , and so the pilgrimage route was started from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is turned again and again at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches in order to sing together a song from specially composed pilgri@@ m lyrics . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , par@@ son@@ age groups of the local par@@ ishes stood at their disposal . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty , well @-@ balanced dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we continued via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags : the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to first desc@@ ended around 500 metres in secondary heat and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at Bad@@ pastures in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg on the final stage . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was given thanks . &quot;
&quot; the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ ch Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , scored as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling &quot;
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor reel , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the return of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff driver .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , as they saw the potential in the Scot@@ sman , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y conquered - and Sk@@ inner were an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked up from his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic board and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side of the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it &apos;s possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly sacred date for British sports ; on the day were also born Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be equivalent to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal winner of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they reached the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , which will focus on W@@ ig@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; he had fought yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ ing , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; drama was played back in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April surrounded by sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first night of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks quite like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melt of Port@@ land is question@@ able due to the removal of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts , as the energy company delivering . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dy to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2,000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there could be dom@@ ino effects as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , informed that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts signed a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the AG@@ L earnings from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the &quot; &quot; expectation of a termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to guarantee the power supply to the melt &quot; does not hin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 , it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still one explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic situation in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
should both systems disappear from the market this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan . Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , scre@@ ened reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n , and in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ hearted plot of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this promotion . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating the Vo@@ gue Cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most popular edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference similar to an image tape rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista have been viewed by the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome ( 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still se@@ eping through before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in the last years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , who like &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Frau Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls below the previous category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women that exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once who appeared on the last cover had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t suit everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to walk around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; municipal centres show 160@@ ,000 people a year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s most common mis@@ cell@@ ors are rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry faces the effects of further mi@@ dd@@ le@@ ties on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected by their seeking for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l parish centre said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the federal government &apos;s resolution being lifted .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed by separation - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Court of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately cancel these funds , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their common denom@@ inations , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Dest@@ ination Campa@@ ign accused of having taken gun
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that their campaign leader for North Carolina condemned a fire@@ arm to a staff while they were on the road in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i gave up for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled within , before he realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ men and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and appoint a judge . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the government parties SPD and CD@@ U draw . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to rule , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses with 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are returning to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD voted only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; in this way , they still lie behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be present at the House of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas in contrast to 2011 pirates would miss the move . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
&quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite mess@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros fans can still buy appliances on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it Computer Fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in western pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails , even by fax , was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers if also agon@@ izing slowly .
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot;
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft .
&quot; today , the market is domin@@ ating vendors , who have come a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; anytime and anywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs at the Mac World announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the trium@@ ph@@ al march of Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel at the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flo@@ cking to the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question posed to him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion of fun growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is backed by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse game &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block sign@@ posts on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection on which part of the page advertising is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it had found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the announ@@ cing Open Source Community and the envel@@ ops has already been under way since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how worried display lock@@ ers have become the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion users active on Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has said it to desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large amount of revenue , so Facebook is re@@ viewing the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ encing Tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have focused on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman in presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday had a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman settled in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she still died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said , asking these as well as any witness of the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter distributed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person was running on the motorway in the dark , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , interro@@ gated the court . &quot;
&quot; the court asser@@ ted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , atmosphere @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to shelter life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus mani@@ f@@ ests its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously assumed by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was once probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as Trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy with@@ drew from Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations and led to a lower right of co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I have thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick was informed today about this decision , &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as the Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal &apos;s Canadi@@ ans and Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put strikes &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles with regard to the remuneration for northern sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties ple@@ dge for a new round of talks to the table , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; stated in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice is below a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell fired up thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes ever held in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of approximately $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods are associated with planetary development .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rates , these stra@@ pping stars exp@@ el large amounts of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between appearing a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest generation of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull is comparing the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot to know about what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars de@@ cel@@ er@@ ate their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; rotation rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional release , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12th August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game player of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star awarded &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; a ster@@ oid prohibited between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a development in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the principal suspect for years to have received funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could have done me a favour for 2014 , because I have played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ eter . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the circumstances with Pop @-@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the trailer at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ i@@ ova and Adrian Go@@ in@@ sky are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; catch : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive ath@@ lete would have won almost one medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 m steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ i@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski , have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final about 100 m of butter@@ flies , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the procedures over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B Trial and hearing has been requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association took the matter &quot; &quot; very serious and demands a full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C , instead of the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news was sick@@ ened by the positive sample of Dan@@ i@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance is supposed to be the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ i@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Go@@ in@@ sky &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , especially the Dan@@ i@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ ing , although the Kenya L@@ äu@@ er@@ nation produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous decline in China caused severe clas@@ hes between the athletes in the swimming pool . &quot;
so Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took off the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to give it over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware currently attack specific companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were reported at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to reci@@ proc@@ ate ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as after archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files enco@@ des the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als on a sustainable basis .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the end turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still running . &quot;
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a Ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stagn@@ ation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims per chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky winn@@ ings from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the existing malware @-@ kits were created by purchasing the malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful acquisition , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators will be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top falls somewhat down . &quot;
&quot; more versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is in the storage room . &quot;
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with up@@ lifted and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to ceilings . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the height at 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter turbo with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
&quot; he should , however , make his work a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is available : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; in the tested top variant , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems include the City emergency brake assist system ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because , when maneu@@ vering , it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tem@@ p re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and stran@@ ts the speed when required .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros , diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standards .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger &apos;s bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger lift .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of disease : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , people with dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests show signs of the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , a family on the second day of their door@@ step was severely ill in diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the holiday@@ makers back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family believed that the trip had been insufficient - and compla@@ ined to the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the treatment plant was defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er soon learned about the pla@@ inti@@ ff before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his duty of information , so the verdict . &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no contamination has been found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - is part of the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorism .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and sch@@ ism .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if a perpetr@@ ator would have to leave the country more quickly , however , this would increase the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot;
promoting terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right to use weapons in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed sweat @-@ duty for physicians should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view on psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against opportun@@ ism .
&quot; that was an ear@@ thing for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and abol@@ ishing double nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear for constitutional problems .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; the Green leader , Simone Peter , proposed that he wants to simulate acts of action and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist packages . &quot;
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the common right bring people in this country no more security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the Autobahn feeder
it is regularly st@@ owed on the envel@@ oping route - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car @-@ drivers , who are in traffic on the street every evening in traffic when they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will extend in the area between Hammer Road and the Wes@@ er Straße exit at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then enter directly from the Hammer road to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : traffic is sharing early , thus improving the entire course of life on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the passenger car eng@@ agements on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only drawn in a single lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be rebuilt in three @-@ four@@ ths years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load force , in order to take the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory @-@ daily traffic jam will continue , the competent national company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is possible to calculate with years : the bridge has an official residual usable period up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the right @-@ to @-@ hand waste treatment , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art company deliberately chose the reduced time during the school holidays because with disabilities it was to be expected . &quot;
traffic will be passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule attended the theatre piece &quot; Das invisible Haus . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; of the boy theater Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 pupils from eleven to fifteen years visited the staging in the little house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most youngsters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ys , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without refugee and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language education are being planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ car@@ p @-@ gu@@ ck@@ lers in the southwest of Germany at night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing do not think of sleep anymore . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Research and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an on@@ e- and sleep @-@ sleep @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely the sleep that many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German family medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines , can also be stuck behind it . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , gives the process an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor &apos;s advice .
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is worn off , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to ease sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there is hardly any inferior sleep medicine , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should consult your GP about sleeping problems at first . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in case of illness , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ ba@@ iting explains . &quot;
it is actually not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; just do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ba@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; after the sealing , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; you can &apos;t sleep too long , don &apos;t sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , avoid drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he was awarded gold for the first time in Doh@@ a , and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has been protecting himself via Facebook before his ex @-@ team colleagues in the criti@@ ques . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 € , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see it as closely or even operate it in the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not saying that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how one should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot;
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Al@@ erts arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civilians from the Düsseldorf police performed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had carried out several pocket and bag ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft of theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year , and were very professional and professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 , who had entered Germany specifically for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences , can prove four acts . &quot;
&quot; in the process , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few tree @-@ broo@@ ks , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ aer Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like that at first sight , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you walk along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , are preferred over the last few weeks preferably with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator handle has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers were cleared , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , construction workers , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , renovated the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal and one day later police and construction workers pulled away under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house project , there are primary schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who here lives three children , are particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted several police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
&quot; the tren@@ ches , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police do between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the rest of the city , Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional work@@ station that has a lower average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; house occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tives from all over the world . residents of GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on the windows or newly painted fac@@ ades thrown with paint bags .
no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ wing violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as physical injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of the crimes is causing damage to property , which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant house in addition to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ rd : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they don &apos;t have been . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately pulled into the streets of Riga - and remained .
&quot; for this reason it was also so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , the politicians and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well @-@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of bred tra@@ ilers : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub quarter , can complain badly about noise . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a New Refu@@ gee Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker on the spot . &quot;
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the master@@ ful wo@@ ollen mil@@ k@@ sow , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; for example , some - less spot@@ ting than on the multitude of demanded tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in social work , an experienced wo@@ ollen mil@@ k@@ sow . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka supports Deu@@ sch@@ le honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers are coming soon in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Office Office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work , so you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communal dwell@@ ings need to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a solid lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro @-@ jobs and ou@@ tre@@ ach activities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ one or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do charitable work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean labour .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here , administration and honorary citizenship are also jumping . &quot;
it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time to bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems as well , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
&quot; a difficult question : have the two fears of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach , after the most recent incidents ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk may and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins destroy them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary offices have to look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
they are always in the background that soon a new shock will come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ or itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the judges are already at full capacity to integrate the previous people in a reasonable manner .
&quot; these are about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters sought
the police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and attacked the cl@@ ums@@ y .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 feet tall , probably mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; as a result of the investigation , the police took over several strikes , as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the thres@@ hing went without success .
perhaps the unknow@@ ns were in fact close to the apartment or their escape .
