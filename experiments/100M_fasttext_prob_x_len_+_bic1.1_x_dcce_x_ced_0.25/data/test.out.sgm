<seg id="1">Golfer Langer wins the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes the horses had remembered their holiday, they hunted back home in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career ended up again."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the ALRV's facility. he was not even photographing a horse for a photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"silver Lorrel leaf, champion-tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already swelled him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th award winner of the sports pyramid is a long one.</seg>
<seg id="19">He met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler in Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for athletic success, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades Langer has been promoting young talent.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US-Masterssieger was added to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Giengen, the champion Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rider Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Judoka Frank Wieneke, the rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sporting legend came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadium where the Lavazza price was running."</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the case of doubt, Trump wants to keep it small and warn against how the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively retire on regulations, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged chances to open and it needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in order to invest in this, Trump and Clinton are almost wordy."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate denounces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the republicans by the state-critical Teaparty wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, there could still be partial-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and drive coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement he wants to cancel."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its investment programme, Clinton specifically wants to expand renewable energy and demand:" a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpositive trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid even better, for example, Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to get up, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics contend him so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Flight: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is for women who are fleeing alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the area manager of Condrobs, a supporter of social welfare services in Bavaria and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for allready-bred women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs has set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence in her flight," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are pursued politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hoppers." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, there are other reasons for the escape:" many steal away from it because they see no other way out. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, mislead, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the Munich north, traumatized, estimated them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about what they experienced, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodation just for them, ask Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in the accommodations of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, flushed women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are floors or own houses for single women and their children in some communal dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are hosted separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing, men and women are lodged together, it can lead to perpetual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much women feel this need of protection can be read by the rush, which is placed on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more working conditions from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that the ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" "persistently quiet" "had to pose problems, which led the contract to be rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC committee voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solicit official new negotiations on all your worries."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot forbid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if it had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm rather seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to remember."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was rampant.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Setting up the trust will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month in a failed state coup."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vehrsti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, because it's reaction to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">The ongoing resentment on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus for claiming that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course, which even has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an" alliance of outsiders "once described by an analyst: two countries that are violating from the West, and are badly treated and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once more."</seg>

<seg id="16">"now I say that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer run its Six Nations Sponsorship and that it will increase the acceptability of the different brands in its sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to become a bank of brands, because how do we concentrate on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "said the chairman of the board."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it reads (in Russian) that later he was the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer of the government personnel."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state in law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest friends of Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigns on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile on the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president at once would want to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust your posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed, that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Putin became prime minister before he became president, three and a half years later."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">"engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings to the square, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economics Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, nearly 79% of the total deck deck is in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project is the closure of forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the North Tower, we had to close the existing gap to the north or the north."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team were working, they were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building off-priced apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens think: in future investors should be taken much more into duty.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next council session, the SPD is proposing a" "housing concept". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, it's about the question: who should build cheap apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann believes:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future exhibit 20 percent of all housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also be built in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, said Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction program, which will cost millions of costs and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, said Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of it, so Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how can one reconcile the loss of other around 1300 budget apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this from happening, the planning politician Nicole Palm should now buy out-of-date links from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western city, Fristen are running at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price connection for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the number of social housing in the western city is increased again drastically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said S & D leader Holger Herlitschke:" "for a broad majority the CDU must go to the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand sank in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been shifted by massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokemon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the barge and jumped to find the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the" average "person recovers every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that followed 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the game's market launch, the number of subsequent people who exercise 30 minutes every day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" 30 minutes time to come "from the sofa and" to be active every day "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also grueling addicts who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will let up with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active, supporter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the sport of sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected it to be a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition competition, a winning series that will last for as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even though Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture clouded."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hovering beams and floor pits - in which Bilit holds the world title - lautered.</seg>

<seg id="29">"Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her grandma - a pure formality - and tears flowed brilliantly on biles bright red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Raisman's performance was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team of the team, which is called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her floor exercise she threw the audience of Kusshalls, overwhelmed by a comeback, which was sometimes doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie "</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, rounds off everyone."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising OlympiaWinner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, but masterful gynectics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold in an individual multicampaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport, but so turn classes do not look out all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to put it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and turns Turner primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to offer to the municipalities of innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible exercise training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated you to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37th resident physicians who voted for election rejected him."</seg>

<seg id="4">The first Doctors will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend bites to improve care at unattended times.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistance physicians told last night in a message saying:" "assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and it will be administered to treat all physicians appropriately."</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by discussions have met with the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes silence-numbing silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the case of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift up the constraint and address the concerns of assistance physicians."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if he should not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further employment measures."</seg>

<seg id="13">"the BMA wants a better weekendcompensation for the 54,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS employees, urged the assistance physicians to end the strike."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "working conditions do not reach anything but little, but already burden overburdened teams and service providers and prepare patients, caregivers and their families to worry, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we talked to the assistant of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training courses, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education, and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture boosts electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"last year, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office for corruption due to corruption"</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread dismissal in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally accesses the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring the evidence of electoral abuse due to" "oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now a slave-king, said that the intimidation of electors from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside of ballot boxes to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters must carry out a reference to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must simply name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger when they vote their vote, in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial structure that accompanies it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman was supposed to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarmingly to the fraudulent correspondence - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including driving out evidence to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "evidence has been attached that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi context."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of "politically correct" insensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists edit stamp papers to stop" harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone chooses twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the elective stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, in order to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters alone go to the election cabin."</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany on corrupt and illegal practices," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the effective "checkups" of the election registration departments of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court case at Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to rotate the spear for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when approaching from behind, you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and" move out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker splashes out of pain, the weapon is out of his hands. hit him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"at attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shuts down his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undernourished his immune system and litters of a serious test by liking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a Euro note, a railings at Piccadilly Circus, a pull-in button of a pull-in toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before finishing each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leakage the rinsing button of a pull-on toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked out, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to dishwashing of toilets, the task was to definitively put its immune system under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial finish showed a luminometer score of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That comes closest to the worst thing I have dug in a toilet." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more discouraged than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not gonna stop here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have checked out some of the things that I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to leak and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of gastro and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social home after a deletion with a loss of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative's shocked employees found the property in an irreparable situation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had perforated holes, wooden planks were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, working for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in that way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror that the family had added was street fights with baseball bats, narcotics of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, quarrels and floods."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be invoked regularly by the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbors who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't bother anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we are saying the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "this morning we couldn't sleep." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, waste and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it's a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a deletion is always the last step, considering Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeepers will need to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after having found himself guilty of possession of a drug of class B in commercial custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police says they will deloze tenants who don't stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told that the deletion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without deductions, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"he who doesn't fit and looms himself, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany anticipates tens of thousands of asylum seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" "a few hundred thousand", "believes the president of the association Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh secret of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurds community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight against the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of the association Ali Toprak of the "World" on Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government has already passed Kurdish strongholds with sanctions several months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the iced putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would still be added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that absorbs refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of the Association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or distributed over the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Chief of the Association demanded that the Federal Government positions itself" "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because more stupid than before, it does not matter: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election champions, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the locals, so must not choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes in the end, only work tiring."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition-dusting.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the land, spreads roses and chats a little chat with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for AfD's thriving."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create, "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its Spitzenkandidaten, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if one turns into the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to open meetings; Merkel's federal elections lie in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual campaign conditions on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, according to cocaert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the countryside you have to crumble the base, so that it has to work very hard once again to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are on the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the vast expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the council of the CDU campaigner Cocoert to his comrades is, however, self-exposing:" they have to go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is at stake, Sellering has called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats lagged at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of holiday times and largely lay their electoral campaigns on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign", "it calls the President Claudia Müller."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green campaigners go on a search for local stimulants among the tourists."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is sanitised.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am in the morning and ending only at 8 pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything pretty shaky," "tells Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the weekend, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the subject is also commended to the construction of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift trips."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been abolished, and therefore the link to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofandynia from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes considerable complaints," says the deputy head office manager Florian King, responsible for the technical management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bach's Street, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many scarpathways were seeking and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some lorry was franchised in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," "King says, who made himself clear about the situation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been inflated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was 77 kilometers per hour in the speed-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become more quiet."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment of them has led to revenue bursts, everyone you ask has to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some are less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Thomas Sulz also talks about a" "maximum slight drop" "at the dealership of Maier, but also admits that, of course," "the leak is missing." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the inns have" hit hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the sales revenue is" "far above 50 percent". ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The road marking has been discarded "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages of the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous was handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now see less frequently due to complicated transport, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his family-klifts come back at the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction, which is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="2">"following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior, de Maizière, now presents a large security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconöhner.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are" politically reasonable "to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package."</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other additional points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">"also, I took part in this."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, he was on the basis of results and a" recoverable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot has already been announced, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on air passenger data and weapons legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come as a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière will start a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD: he wants to make sympathies for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with double nationality the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"that will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-man admits. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he does not consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing, which in the coalition partner doesn't have any chances anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few new ideas are presented by de Maizière, too."</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partially in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for incarcerating people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the event of tolerances for expired asylum seekers, he wants to face some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or intentionally throw their papers away to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally heated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still work unpolished and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in the face of the high refugee population, many people worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things, which people deeply occupied, could not be clutched even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has enormously moved into focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are elections."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, Union and SPD are increasingly in position on the issue of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, the two parties went high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garsty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Ministers, in which the department leaders also demand a Burka prohibition and a reversal of the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for irreconcilable sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He thinks of a departure from a double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It does not make sense to recharge you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and in the case of a Burka ban, he has objectionable objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether his own package is constitutionally unconstitutional and if it is actually" "reasonable" "for the coalition partner, only has to show itself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot of things that could cause strife.</seg>

<seg id="9">"sales in Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, accounted for 14 percent of the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the home market of Germany, deliveries declined by almost one sixth."</seg>
<seg id="11">Jürgen Stackmann's sales director Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker numbers in July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="17">"from January to July, Head of Sales, Fred Kappler, continued to present a sales division."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5.904 million worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="25">"the" Focus "had reported that Volkswagen is now making a guarantee for its German customers, however, a guarantee of reindeer diesel models."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Records: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of medium-old love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you come to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym of Non-Allegrene Men's Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the re-emergence of gramophone records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but can be attributed to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, keeping a humble gray suit and saying something like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of medium age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approximately 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), revet the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records which he could not afford, when they appeared and again sold items which he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably a bit too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers, who he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took offense on the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar gramophone envelopes, from objects that evoke happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flirts from a stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the poll also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I planing through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently here and said," "I don't own a record player but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put it on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly entering."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest Synthesizer- and sexist Pop instead of experimental jazz moans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychtraumas are hard to detravel when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more of a window-shopping than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of panel lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I pretended to discourage the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxuries such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research suggests that the results of YouGov are right, at least in sheet stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums is not considered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not by strolling through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the stubborn look of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator who doesn't raise any unsuspecting middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which carry a fire and sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for assigning people who run 72 provisional shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" "absolutely traceable." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated in a communal manner and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimates on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-point Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji granted a class class in handling, side-quiling, back-back, line-up and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal in any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji had beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who were sitting at the tail, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic champion in a second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional cost in millionaires.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from the oil flow promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the German Steel Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" West German Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ), said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs (WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a result, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"further must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emission trading market," "stated IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and substantial price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation further intensified as the world's largest producer country China threw iron on the world market in view of the weakest domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers submit price dumping to Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has eased a bit."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties were imposed on import steel, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China were brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been more stagnant again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent lower crude steel than in the prior-year period, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the gathered quantity returned for the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp's whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old is singing in an elderly choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German Senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"thanks to regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve at the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak up and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of unity."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"because of this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher significance; it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, it explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers are sinking into long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially elderly people who live alone, practice so not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem increases also by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby shouldn't delay - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, Seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for any age.</seg>

<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, so Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>

<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed before the territory of the coastal police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "said Army general Danai Kritamavee Fridays before journalists."</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express itself on possible motives, but probably it is the action of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage which is limited to limited territories and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have received secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they have not been informed of the exact time and place."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always some smaller bombings, but they are mostly not against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"after the new bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary journeys to these provinces are discouraged."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (Level 2) applies for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence also in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Military Unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, will benefit himself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="18">"Maate said, I don't have any findings."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point onwards."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the party - in this case, the AfD - will change its direction and become extremist by certain individuals who are extremist."</seg>

<seg id="26">"it can be quite possible that other rightist groups or small groups are forming to plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>

<seg id="30">This is the worrying thing.</seg>

<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to go on alone in a course of more than 100 metres."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at that time, Moussambani was fired."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a surging calculation, the wastewater fee in Azendorf will then lie at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household through the municipal council Kulmbach, it was established that these wastewater facilities are running under cover."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Casino market is obligated to operate the plants on a cost-covering basis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welzahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the board, a re-calculation of fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period can also be equalled."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the serious charges increased by Schmidt with the fact that there were relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack on all three sewage plants, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water flow in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period in all three plants, refurbishment and repair expenses were not least noticed in all three plants due to their age."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposes of and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" for these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came into consideration. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Schmidt, added to this, was spared the market community of large entertainment costs in the sewage plants over the past 20 years."</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect has been criticized as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, it enables Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-flowering, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All mistakes are made to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshots have been criticised in the past where they were accused of creating black face promoting or propagating white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week a few users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photos was widespread, that the filter was" "hurtful and said to say" "unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the descending extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be expected to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium to delete their Snapchat account, asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized most of the white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat mostly unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a personnel officer focused on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu also said that she will be closed to her Snapchat account and added," "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence, Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the military personnel of the United States Central Command changed the intelligence information to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual state of affairs had been allowed on site, reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Defence Committee, Intelligence Committees and the Defence budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, which were typically decentred by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly reported a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The managerial errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, CentCom publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossl could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's peaks changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "gave the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "shamed the morale under analysts and" gave excessively little space for dissenting opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have resorted to repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State commemorates the interacts of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker declared that the government's statements against the refineries held by the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional oil refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centres damaliger orders, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever having done that."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows that the Americans lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 seats."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), at the age of 16 she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympic Games in 2008 as she could not qualify for the squad.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things to a better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work place in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US Army's goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book one goal in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling steady and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmer to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock of dimples, could well have been among these well known names that would have been sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have enough arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so sparsely perceived that many that I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a earth-bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending upswing - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"upcoming winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiad, they are evaluated according to the performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in her quest for gold medallions must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but in the televised transmission also another highlight destination: the world or the Olympiarecord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a contest here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and final results will take place on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time streaming; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block from 2 p.m. onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objective enhancement of male athlets, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police in gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people flocked on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed on all unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the country's most populous country in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terrorism through the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and don't have any other options out of protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Tesco, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold with respect to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which in recent years were more or less forced to take advantage of the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of falling under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians committed themselves to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, prospered mainly in Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mullet Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, dominating around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was sentenced to 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in an unpublicized illness in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscurely reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which according to analysts had apparently been fucked by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Ethiopian development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked from Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronean flights over the neighbouring Somalia, even though she recently announced that she had concluded this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin line of grass."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS to be "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican Republican candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings forth his comrades who make an effort to protect him during an eventful phase, to explain in the peculiar position, statements he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the announcement of an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was calling back to claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant that the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leashes down to Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their talk boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course, I meant sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more estimated tone since its demand values decreased."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new poll from NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general tried not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocate, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani, questioning Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back-broker, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an external minister, allowed ISIS to spread out aggressively to control the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being preoccupied with him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," They can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked about Mr. Trump's apology as only a further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time staff of old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafe."</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his accession to the president Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a dessert of plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans, how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs last book" "Chop Suey" "was from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book" "97 Orchard" "tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock crash of 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered mushroom frying, this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," Brickman said. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the roads with which the country was surrounded, no longer to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when the food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," "declared Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became the staple food that Kasserolle recovered as a" "wonderful way to recycle food residue", "Brickman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out because a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy food.</seg>
<seg id="27">"while researching for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Brickmann continued:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the family recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, budget economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - like the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, she encouraged women to become" housekeepers "and the challenge of turning pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historic delicacies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of birth.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland shark floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a pattern for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the Evolutionary biologist has long argued that Greenland's hair is stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know accordingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt asleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadavers, that torso from higher water-layers down."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-sharks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest size is 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably high carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons try to lower large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in their lentils, all larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark while the record-shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane emes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the old record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, where a 120-year old harpoon tip was stuck on the neck, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal buys warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor reel, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory of the favourites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the return of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff driver.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, as they saw the potential in the Scotsman, which now unfolds."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy conquered - and Skinner were an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked up from his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic board and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 on the side of the Kenny and Hoys side, he admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like all the UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it's possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equivalent to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal winner of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, which will focus on Wiggins."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shanding, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"drama was played back in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director Shane Sutton in April surrounded by sexism and Mobbingvores as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first night of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt of Portland is questionable due to the removal of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts, as the energy company delivering."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidy to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"not less than 2,000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, there could be domino effects as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" hedging transactions, "which should have come into effect from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts signed a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the AGL earnings from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $187 million in the" "expectation of a termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to guarantee the power supply to the melt "does not hinder."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010, it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still one explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic situation in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts each year and consume around 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">"and it wouldn't be good for us as a generator," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estée Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," wrote Kendall. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians-like?), screened reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché-hearted plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this promotion."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of kardashians has certainly begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her beating the Vogue Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most popular edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference similar to an image tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista have been viewed by the 832 pages of the tome (615 pages of advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still seeping through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the last years there were clearly more" celebrities, who like "as" models, "celebrities are" on the cover. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Frau Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls below the previous category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even if everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women that excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce who appeared on the last cover had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't suit everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and she called them "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to walk around on the misfortune seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="26">It works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flocking to the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question posed to him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of fun growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games from 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"for companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blockage are the same as a" cat and mouse game. ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block signposts on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection on which part of the page advertising is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her battle between the announcing Open Source Community and the envelops has already been under way since the invention of display blockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worried display lockers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published last year by Pageair and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide use display blockers; almost four times as much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion users active on Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the company has said it to desktop PCs, since mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, shared a speaker."</seg>
<seg id="11">"advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large amount of revenue, so Facebook is reviewing the investment of such a step as worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" "Ad Preferencing Tool" "to give people more control over their targeted advertising."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that AdBlocks would be worrying about new filters, because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"for the users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an email message. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday had a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman settled in the dark" in an act of despair "on the road and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said, asking these as well as any witness of the incident to sign up."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter distributed the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - where a person was running on the motorway in the dark, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after having passed a man and killed one night on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, interrogated the court."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, atmosphere-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to shelter life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus manifests its day-side of the sun almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously assumed by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once probably habitable, Venus was exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve at different rates as well as in what connection the rotation periods are associated with planetary development.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 light years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rates, these strapping stars expel large amounts of star winches."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between appearing a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest generation of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull is comparing the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slower than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," "said Rebull."</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," "said Rebull."</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack specific companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialist Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were reported at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a Ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to reciprocate ransom is considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as after archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the Ransomware and deletes the originals on a sustainable basis.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the end turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still running."</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a Ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims per chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed after payment of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky winnings from Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1,60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top falls somewhat down."</seg>
<seg id="7">"more versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in the storage room."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l with uplifted and 1026 l with inverted back rests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m high from the ground up to ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the height at 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter turbo with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he should, however, make his work a little quieter."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>

<seg id="17">But the steering should be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the tested top variant, the equipment leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the safety systems include the City emergency brake assist system (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warning sometimes irritates because, when maneuvering, it evaluates many obstacles as" approaching objects. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temp reacts to the traffic sign recognition and strants the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, the full connectivity is available only for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far before the wake-up ringing do not think of sleep anymore."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an one- and sleep-sleep-disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is precisely the sleep that many people perceive as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German family medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medicines, can also be stuck behind it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in depression," "says Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, gives the process an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor's advice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is worn off, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to ease sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany there is hardly any inferior sleep medicine, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should consult your GP about sleeping problems at first."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example in snoring with respiratory problems, in case of illness, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fibaiting explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is actually not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just do not take a nap," "says Fibabel."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the sealing, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows the sleeping-ends on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"you can't sleep too long, don't sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, avoid drinking alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"articles about this" trendy neighbourhood, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are preferred over the last few weeks preferably with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator handle has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go-zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the cadmiths, with 300 police officers were cleared, the police patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the meantime, construction workers, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, renovated the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal and one day later police and construction workers pulled away under the rejoicing of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house project, there are primary schools and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who here lives three children, are particularly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted several police protection from the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trenches, which the Berlin inner senator and the police do between house occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in contrast to the rest of the city, Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workstation that has a lower average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"house occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electives from all over the world. residents of GDR times and former home owners share their neighbourhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on the windows or newly painted facades thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year together with the words "left-wing violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as physical injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the biggest part of the crimes is causing damage to property, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant house in addition to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weird: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they don't have been."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately pulled into the streets of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason it was also so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, the politicians and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, they are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are people who are not so well-versed," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>

<seg id="8">"for example, some - less spotting than on the multitude of demanded tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in social work, an experienced woollen milksow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika supports Deuschle honest and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are coming soon in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work, so you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communal dwellings need to be intimidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid lead, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro-jobs and outreach activities for refugees and migrants who have to be undone or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean labour.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here, administration and honorary citizenship are also jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time to bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems as well, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two fears of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach, after the most recent incidents?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine Customer says quite clearly, "what some people may call naive." a residual risk may and may not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins destroy them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary offices have to look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new shock will come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhor itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the judges are already at full capacity to integrate the previous people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
